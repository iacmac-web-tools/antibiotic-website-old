  <p>Pursuant to law, New Jersey controlled dangerous  substances (CDS) registrants are required to register with the New Jersey  Prescription Monitoring Program (NJPMP). To date, approximately 2,500 New  Jersey CDS Physicians have been identified as non-compliant with the NJPMP  registration requirement. As a result, the CDS registration for said physicians  has been placed in &ldquo;active non-renewable&rdquo; (ANR) status and they will be unable  to renew their CDS during the October 2020 renewal period until they&rsquo;ve  successfully registered with the NJPMP. </p>
  <p>In the coming weeks, a detailed notice will be emailed  to those CDS Physicians placed in ANR status advising them of the status of  their CDS and the NJPMP registration requirement and instruct them to  immediately register with the NJPMP. </p>
  <p>No action is required by CDS physicians who already  have an active NJPMP account. </p>
  <p>CDS Physicians who are&nbsp;<strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong>&nbsp;registered  with the NJPMP must: </p>
  <p><strong><u>STEP  1: Register to access the NJPMP</u></strong> <br />
    Immediately register at&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__newjersey.pmpaware.net_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=ZXUMKb8fXA6SUKo38hSQIA&amp;m=e61vOj1duVSSkBQLIkeEssTQU3hlWxPyl1kRZk0fVtc&amp;s=2AN_xB-dRLRI6LUo0OujevKKYzUldU54llRiUzmfkfc&amp;e=" target="_blank">https://newjersey.pmpaware.net/</a>. Registrants will be  required to enter his/her full professional license number; federal Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA) number; NJ CDS registration number; full name  as it appears on his/her professional license; unique email address; and other  identifying information. </p>
  <p><strong><u>STEP  2: Notify the Drug Control Unit</u></strong> <br />
    Once  the physician has registered to access the NJPMP, he/she should notify the New  Jersey Drug Control Unit via email at&nbsp;<u><a href="mailto:CDS@dca.lps.state.nj.us" target="_blank">CDS@dca.lps.state.nj.us</a></u>. </p>
  <p><strong><u>STEP  3: Permission to renew CDS registration</u></strong> <br />
    Following verification of the Physicians NJPMP  registration, the status of his/her CDS registration will be updated to  &ldquo;active&rdquo; and he/she will receive an email permitting him/her to renew his/her  CDS during the October 2020 renewal period. </p>
  <p>Physicians with an active CDS registration that  do&nbsp;<strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong>&nbsp;prescribe controlled dangerous substances  or do&nbsp;<strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong>&nbsp;currently hold a New Jersey DEA  registration<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;in accordance with&nbsp;<u>N.J.A.C.</u>13:45H-1.2(m),  must email the New Jersey Drug Control Unit to place his/her CDS registration  in &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; status. </p>

<div id="1" style="display:none;"><p>The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) Vaccine Preventable Disease Program would like to make you aware of possible exposures to measles occurring at multiple locations in Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, New Jersey and Tennessee. To date, no suspect measles cases related to these exposures have been reported to NJDOH.
<br /><BR />
As of March 22, 2018, an outbreak of eleven confirmed measles cases has been identified in Kansas with additional suspect cases being investigated. Cases visited public places in Johnson, Miami, and Linn counties in Kansas while infectious dating back to March 2, 2018, so there is concern that some individuals in the general population may have been exposed to measles in those counties. One Kansas case visited tourist attractions in and around St. Louis, Missouri on March 13 and March 14. 
<br /><BR />
Unrelated exposures have also occurred recently at three airports: Detroit Metropolitan Airport (Michigan) on March 6, 2018, and Newark Liberty International Airport (New Jersey) and Memphis International Airport (Tennessee) on March 12, 2018.
<br /><BR />
Links to press releases can be found below for additional information on updated exposure locations. NJDOH continues to urge providers to remain vigilant for cases of measles (consider measles in persons who present with fever and rash) and would like to remind all health care and public health professionals about the importance of receiving up-to-date immunizations, especially prior to international travel. 
From January 1 through March 22 this year, 28 confirmed cases of measles were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (AR, IL, IN, KS, MI, NYS, NYC, OK, PA, TN, and TX). All of the cases were import-associated with 13 direct imports and 15 epi-linked to imported cases. Travel countries for the 13 imported cases included India, Pakistan, United Kingdom, and Uganda. In 2018, to date, there have been no confirmed cases of measles in New Jersey.
<br /><BR />
<strong>Measles Overview</strong> Measles is a highly contagious disease that is transmitted by respiratory droplets and airborne spread. The disease can result in severe complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. The incubation period for measles ranges from 7 to 21 days. Individuals are infectious 4 days before and after rash onset. The diagnosis of measles should be considered in any person with a generalized maculopapular rash, fever, and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis. Immunocompromised patients and patients who are not fully immune may have an atypical presentation. <br /><BR />
<strong>Recommendations </strong> Health care providers should maintain vigilance for measles importations and have a high index of suspicion for measles in persons with a clinically compatible illness who have traveled abroad or who have been in contact with travelers. They should assess measles immunity in U.S. residents who travel abroad and vaccinate if necessary. Measles is endemic in many countries, including popular travel destinations. Suspected measles cases should be reported immediately to the local health department, and serologic and virologic specimens (throat/nasopharyngeal swabs and urine) should be obtained for measles virus detection and genotyping. A culture is preferable to serology in vaccinated individuals. Laboratory testing should be conducted in the most expeditious manner possible. <br /><BR />
<strong>Preventing Transmission in Health Care Settings </strong> To prevent transmission of measles in health care settings, airborne infection control precautions (available at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/2007IP/2007isolationPrecautions.html" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/2007IP/2007isolationPrecautions.html</a>) should be followed stringently. Suspected measles patients (i.e., persons with febrile rash illness) should be removed from emergency department and clinic waiting areas as soon as they are identified, placed in a private room with the door closed, and asked to wear a surgical mask, if tolerated. In hospital settings, patients with suspected measles should be placed immediately in an airborne infection (negative-pressure) isolation room if one is available and, if possible, should not be sent to other parts of the hospital for examination or testing purposes. <br /><BR />
All health care personnel should have documented evidence of measles immunity on file at their work location. Having high levels of measles immunity among health care personnel and such documentation on file minimizes the work needed in response to measles exposures, which cannot be anticipated.
<br /><BR />
As an added precaution, hospital Emergency Departments are encouraged to provide signage which directs staff and/or patients to identify anyone presenting with fever and rash.
<br /><BR />
<strong>In Summary</strong> <ol><li> Report all suspect measles cases (febrile illness accompanied by generalized maculopapular rash) immediately (DO NOT WAIT FOR LABORATORY CONFIRMATION) to the local health department. If unable to reach the local health department, notify the NJDOH during regular business hours at (609) 826-5964. After business hours, or on the weekend, call NJDOH at (609) 392-2020. 
<li> Place all patients with suspected measles in airborne isolation immediately.
<li> Obtain clinical specimens for diagnostic testing from blood (for both IgM and IgG to measles), urine, nasopharyngeal aspirates/throat swabs.
<li> Determine the immune status of contacts. Offer measles vaccine or immune globulin to susceptible exposed contacts as appropriate. Quarantine contacts who cannot produce documentation of immunity from day 5 through day 21 following exposure. 
<li> Assure that all those eligible for MMR vaccine receive appropriate and timely vaccination.</ol> <br /><BR />

 <h1><strong>New  Jersey Residents Who Are Current/Former Patients at TomorrowвЂ™s Medicine in New  York Encouraged to Get Tested for Hepatitis and HIV</strong></h1>
 <p>The  New York State Department of Health is advising current and former patients who  received intravenous infusions, injections or blood draws at Tomorrow  MedicineвЂ™s two Westchester County locations to get tested for hepatitis B  (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is  spread through exposure to blood.&nbsp;<br />
   TomorrowвЂ™s  Medicine is at the center of a hepatitis C investigation being conducted by the  New York State Department of Health and the Westchester County Department of  Health. Four patients from the practice with HCV were identified during an  ongoing investigation. The investigation revealed that some patients might have  become infected with HCV due to lapses of infection control and concerns  regarding the preservation, preparation, handling and administration of  medication. The practiceвЂ™s patient list includes residents from multiple  states, including New Jersey. The medical license of TomorrowвЂ™s Medicine owner,  Dr. Timothy Morley, has been suspended and he has been ordered to stop  practicing medicine, pending a formal hearing, by the New York Health  Commissioner.<br />
   TomorrowвЂ™s  Medicine has two locations:</p>
 <ul type="disc">
   <li>37 Moore Avenue,       #3, Mount Kisco, NY</li>
   <li>1133 Westchester       Avenue, White Plains, NY</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Patients  should also be tested if they received services at a previous medical practice  known as Advanced Medicine of Mount Kisco.</p>
Individuals who are current or former patients  of TomorrowвЂ™s Medicine and received intravenous infusions, injections or blood  draws are recommended to contact their health care provider to get tested.  Testing is also available at no cost for patients through the Westchester  County Department of Health (NY) by calling (914) 995-7499 Monday through  Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Representatives from the New York State Department  of Health are available to answer questions at 1-888-364-4902, Monday through  Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

<H1>Opioid Epidemic Update</h1>
<p align="left">The President recently directed federal agencies to use all appropriate emergency and other authorities to respond to the crisis caused by the opioid epidemic.  The federal InterAgency Board (IAB) publication "Recommendations on Selection and Use of Personal Protective Equipment and Decontamination Products for First Responders Against Exposure Hazards to Synthetic Opioids, Including Fentanyl and Fentanyl Analogues" establishes guidance for personal protective equipment selection and use, decontamination, detection, and medical countermeasures for first responders who may be exposed to opioids in the course of their occupational activities.
 <br /><BR />
Given these events, knowing that we're two weeks away from the Labor Day weekend and closing in on some important anniversaries (such as 9/11), and understanding that we've yet to enter the peak of our "hurricane season," now is the opportune time to review emergency plans, policies, and procedures; test equipment; check supplies and other resources; reinforce organizational structures and emergency job responsibilities; and, drill/exercise to test capabilities.  Below you will find an updated PDF version of our "Preparedness Briefing" with links to resources critical for your emergency preparedness and operations; also attached are the two PDF posters we've published on initial steps during emergency operations, and considerations for different types of emergencies (hard copies are available by emailing contact.preparedness at doh.nj.gov).

    <BR />
    You should also be reminded to be on alert for any unusual disease activity.  NJDOH reviews data from emergency departments statewide to facilitate the recognition of disease outbreaks.  However, the NJDOH always relies on clinicians to report by telephone those conditions that require immediate notification, including any suspected cluster or outbreak of disease or any unusual clinical presentation.  Report immediately notifiable conditions, or other issue of public health concern, to the local health department (LHD) where the patient resides, or to the local health department of the event or outbreak.  If LHD personnel are unavailable, healthcare providers should report the case to the NJDOH Communicable Disease Service at 609-826-5964, (normal business hours) or 609-392-2020 (weekends, evenings, and holidays).

    Lastly, The American Hospital Association (AHA) recently conducted a comprehensive study on the financial impact of violence to hospitals and healthcare systems, the first research of its kind. It studied both community or public violence as well as in-facility violence, prevention and preparedness costs, and post-incident costs.  The AHA estimates proactive and reactive violence response cost hospitals and health systems in the United States approximately $2.7 billion in 2016 (PDF, 341 kb), broken down as such:        
  <ul>
  <li>$280 million in preparedness and prevention addressing community violence.</li>
<li>$852 million in unreimbursed medical care for victims.</li>
<li>$1.1 billion in prevention of violence within hospitals.</li>
<li>$429 million spent as a result of violence against hospital employees.</li></ul>
<p align="left">
These numbers are further broken down in the study results. The AHA presents this data to highlight the enormity of the problem and the demands placed on the medical community and make the information available for further research and action; it does not make any recommendations on addressing the issues.

  <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has announced that  effective January 1, 2017, &nbsp;they are&nbsp;changing its long-standing  policy of allowing a grace period for registrants who failed to file a timely  renewal application. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugreg/index.html" target="_blank">DEA&nbsp;reversed its  decision and posted a notice that it is retaining its current policy and  procedures, with one minor change, regarding registration renewals.</a>&nbsp;  The revised announcement states the following:</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>REVISED ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING RENEWAL APPLICATIONS&nbsp;</strong> <br />
    <strong><em>Starting January  2017,&nbsp;DEA&nbsp;will no longer send its second renewal notification by  mail.&nbsp; Instead, an electronic reminder to renew will be sent to the email  address associated with the&nbsp;DEA&nbsp;registration.</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>At this time,&nbsp;DEA&nbsp;will otherwise retain its current  policy and procedures with respect to renewal and reinstatement of  registration. This policy is as follows:</em></strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong><em>If a renewal application is submitted in a timely       manner prior to expiration, the registrant may continue operations,       authorized by the registration, beyond the expiration date until final       action is taken on the application.</em></strong></li>
    <li>В•<strong><em>DEA&nbsp;allows the reinstatement of an expired       registration for one calendar month after the expiration date. If the       registration is not renewed within that calendar month, an application for       a new&nbsp;DEA&nbsp;registration will be required.</em></strong></li>
    <li>В•<strong><em>Regardless of whether a registration is       reinstated within the calendar month after expiration, federal law       prohibits the handling of controlled substances or List 1 chemicals for       any period of time under an expired registration.</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

<strong>CMS Makes it Easier to Opt Out of EHR Requirements</strong> 
</h2>

<p>The CMS is making it easier for providers to waive out from meaningful use requirements of electronic health records amid a series of proposed changes to the 6-year-old $31.8 billion EHR incentive payment program. In December, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act, which expanded providers' eligibility for hardship exemptions to Stage 2 of the meaningful-use program. 
Basically, the law provides the CMS with the authority to batch process hardship applications by categories instead of the case-by-case method used previously. To comply with the law, the CMS posted a new streamlined hardship application, reducing the amount of information that providers must submit to apply for an exception. Eligible professionals will have until March 15 to apply for an exemption.

        <strong>Precautions to Avoid Norovirus </strong></p></td>

    <tr>
      <td><p>As    expected, New Jersey is experiencing an increase in norovirus outbreaks and    Health Commissioner Mary E. O'Dowd reminds residents to take precautions to    protect their health. Colds and flu are not the only infections that thrive    in the winter. Norovirus - sometimes called the stomach flu, viral    gastroenteritis, or food poisoning - also likes the colder    weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        &quot;The    best way to avoid the norovirus is to wash your hands often using soap and    water,&quot; Commissioner O'Dowd said. &quot;Alcohol-based hand cleansers are    not effective against this virus.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
        Norovirus    is a highly contagious viral illness, which begins suddenly and usually    causes stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Some people may also    experience low-grade fever, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue. Most    people recover quickly, but serious complications can occur - particularly in    those with other medical conditions.&nbsp; Those infected with norovirus are    contagious from the moment they begin to feel sick until as long as two weeks    after recovery.&nbsp;<br />
        There    is no vaccine to prevent norovirus infection and there is no drug to treat    it. The best way to reduce the risk of getting norovirus is to:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Practice good         hand hygiene.&nbsp; Wash your hands with soap and water, especially         after using the bathroom and changing diapers. </li>
          <li>Carefully wash         fruits and vegetables and cook oysters and other shellfish before eating </li>
          <li>Do not prepare         food while infected or while you have symptoms of norovirus </li>
          <li>Foodhandlers         should wait 3 days after they recover from their illness before         returning to work. </li>
          <li>Clean and         disinfect contaminated surfaces.&nbsp; After throwing up or having         diarrhea, immediately clean surfaces by using bleach-based household         cleaner as directed on the product label or a diluted bleach solution         (5-25 tablespoons of household bleach per gallon of water). Never use         undiluted bleach. </li>
          <li>Remove and         wash clothing and linens that may be contaminated with vomit or         stool.&nbsp; Handle soiled items carefully to avoid spreading the virus.         If available, wear rubber, disposable gloves while handling soiled         clothing or linens and wash your hands after handling. Items should be         washed with detergent at the maximum cycle length and machine dried. </li>
          <li>Report all         outbreaks to the local health department.&nbsp; </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Noroviruses    are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the US. It is estimated that    each year, more than 20 million cases of gastroenteritis are caused by    norovirus. That means that 1 in every 15 Americans will become ill from    norovirus each year.&nbsp; In New Jersey, approximately 100 norovirus    outbreaks are reported to the health department each fall-winter    season.&nbsp;<br />
          Noroviruses    can spread quickly from person to person in crowded, closed places like    long-term care facilities, daycare centers, schools, hotels, hospitals,    family dinners, student housing, restaurants, and cruise ships. In other    words, places where people often eat food that is prepared or handled by    others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
          Noroviruses    are found in the stool and vomit of infected people. People can become    infected by:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Eating food or         drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus. </li>
          <li>Touching         surfaces or objects that are contaminated with norovirus, and then         placing your hand in your mouth. </li>
          <li>Having direct         contact with an infected person; for example, by exposure to the virus         when caring for or when sharing food, drinks, or eating utensils with an         infected person.&nbsp; </li>
        </ul>
