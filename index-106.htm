						<h2>How Travel Vaccination Clinics Can Help Your Kidneys</h2>
						<p>Another topic we want to discuss is the importance of ensuring you are taking the proper precautions when you are traveling to different countries. There are many diseases out there that can be prevented with travel vaccines. Travel vaccinations or "travel shots" can be a great way to make sure you have a fun and safe trip. Depending on where you are traveling to, New York City has some great options for you such as <a href="https://www.globaltraveler.com">Dr. Narula: Travel Clinics NYC</a>. It's not only important to ensure your kidneys stay healthy, but also your overall body by using travel immunizations.</p>
					    You can find Dr. Narula at:<br />

						<h2>Use Digital Marketing and SEO to Grow Your Kidney Practice</h2>
						<p>There are so many kidney doctors out there that have amazing practices, but unfortunately many don't have the marketing department to monitor their online presence in search engines like Google, and social sites like Facebook or Yelp. We wanted to give some quick tips that we hope will benefit the general <a href="http://health.usnews.com/wellness">health and wellness community</a> by helping great surgeons and doctors to get found by their ideal patients.</p>
						<p>First, make sure your <a title="WebMD" href="http://www.webmd.com">medical site</a> is indexed in Google. Secondly, make sure your site is relevant for the keywords that your patients will type into Google such as "<a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Nephrologists&find_loc=Orange+County%2C+CA">kidney specialist in Orange County</a>" or "Irvine kidney doctor"; or whatever city you happen to practice in. Next, be sure to give such fantastic service that your clients rave about you and leave 5-star reviews on Yelp, Facebook, and others. These are just a few internet marketing strategies that you can implement to improve your online presence. For more in-depth social and search engine optimization strategies we recommend reaching out to a reputable SEO agency that has a proven track record and follows all of Google search guidelines.</p>
						    <h2>Make Sure You Get Covered - If Not, Credit Repair May Need To Be An Option</h2>
						    <p>Having <a href="https://www.uhc.com">good healthcare</a> is a must if you plan on keeping not just your kidneys healthy long term, but the rest of your body! There are many different companies to choose from, but sometimes you can't get an affordable plan because you are self-employed or maybe the health coverage through your employer is too high. Hopefully, if this is your case, you have good credit so that any loans or other payment plans are either a lower amount, or have a lower interest rate because you were able to successfully repair your credit in the past.</p>
						    
						    <p>Side note: if you have bad credit, you will definitely want to find a quality credit repair company so you don't have to worry about possibly paying full price for a healthcare program. The last thing you want in your life is financial troubles. Our blog cares not only about your physical well-being, but also your financial well-being.</p>
							<h3>Welcome to Renal Kidney Health Blog</h3>
							<p>We are all about the health of our readers. Kidney health is vital to a thriving lifestyle. <a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/fivesuprisingwayskidneydamage">Kidney.org</a> gives a great article on what NOT to do to keep your kidneys healthy. Below is our list of what <u>to</u> do on a regular basis to give yourself the best possible chance to enjoy healthy kidneys for life. </p>

<h2>9 Ways To Keep Your Kidneys As Healthy As Possible</h2>
<p>There are many different things that can cause an increased risk for developing kidney disease. These things include diabetes, high blood pressure, and having a family history of kidney failure. However, even if you do not fit inside any of these risk categories, it is still important to take care of your vital organs.</p>
<p>The good news is there are plenty of different things that you can do in order to keep your kidneys as healthy as possible and functioning optimally. In this article, we will be going over some of the different ways in which you can keep your kidneys as healthy as possible and prevent renal failure.</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<h3>Secrets to Kidney Health:</h3>

<h4>1. Hydrate, But Not Too Much.</h4>
<p>Contrary to what a lot of people might believe, over <a title="Gatorade Hydration" href="http://www.gatorade.com">hydration</a> is not an effective thing to do in order to make the kidneys work better. While it is a good idea to drink enough water throughout each day, drinking excessively is not going to help your kidneys function any better than they would with sufficient intake.</p>

<h4>2. Eat Healthy Foods.</h4>
<p>As with anything, healthy eating is going to help optimize your kidney function. While your kidneys can tolerate a wide range of different dietary habits, a lot of kidney problems arise due to various medical conditions such as having high blood pressure and even diabetes. With this being said, it is important to not only control what you eat, but also to control your weight. Preventing different things such as diabetes and even high blood pressure can go a long way towards keeping your kidneys functioning properly and keeping them as healthy as possible.</p>

<h4>3. Regular Exercise.</h4> 
<p>Another thing that you are going to want to do in order to keep your kidneys as healthy as possible is get in regular exercise each and every day. If you are healthy, getting regular exercise is a very good idea because it can keep you from gaining an excessive amount of weight and it can also help you avoid suffering from different things such as high blood pressure.</p>

<h4>4. Use Caution When Taking Supplements.</h4>
<p>Some people overdo it when they are taking supplements and/or herbal remedies. If you are planning on taking any kind of supplement, you are going to want to make sure that you speak to your registered health professional before you do so. A lot of supplements and herbal remedies on the market can have negative consequences on your bodily organs. For this reason, you want to make sure that you are not overdoing it when it comes to taking supplements.</p>

<h4>5. Check With Your Kidney Doctor Before Getting Botox Injections</h4>
<p>Medical spas are a fantastic way to unwind and are becoming increasingly popular, especially in Los Angeles, California, in the United States. With med spas, you get the same benefits of a traditional day spa, but you also get the expertise of actual certified medical practitioners. The aesthetic nurses can recommend a plethora of different types of products from BOTOXВ® injections to chemical peels and facials. Whatever the case may be, we suggest for your kidney health that you check with your doctor before undergoing any major skin treatment at any Botox clinic.</p>

<h4>6. Get Screened.</h4>

<p>Another thing that you are going to want to do on a regular basis is get screened. You want to be sure that you are <a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0615/p1087.html">getting screened on a regular basis</a> because if you suffer from anything like high blood pressure or diabetes, you are going to want to make sure that your kidneys are not suffering as a direct result.</p>

<h4>7. Do Not Smoke.</h4>

<p>Smoking is one of the worst things that you can end up doing to your kidneys according to Davita.com. It can lead to <a href="https://www.davita.com/kidney-disease/overview/living-with-ckd/smoking-and-chronic-kidney-disease/e/4897">chronic kidney disease</a>. The fact is, smoking can effectively slow down the flow of blood to your kidneys. This means that your kidneys are going to have less blood reaching them. The problem that occurs when your kidneys have less blood reaching them is the fact that it impairs their ability to actually function properly. Not to mention, smoking also increases the risk of developing kidney cancer by around 50%. As you can probably tell, smoking is something that you are going to want to avoid completely for the healthiest kidneys.</p>

<h4>8. Avoid Over The Counter Drugs.</h4>

<p>Another thing that you are going to want to do is avoid taking over the counter drugs such as <a href="https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory-agents.html">inflammatory drugs</a> on a regular basis. The reason is because they have been known to cause a lot of different problems including kidney damage and even disease if they are taken on a regular basis. While these medications do not pose immediate danger for healthy kidneys, if you are someone that suffers from kidney problems, you might experience negative results from taking them.</p>

<h4>9. Keep Your Blood Sugar Level Under Control.</h4>

<p><a title="ADA" href="http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/kidney-disease-nephropathy.html">Diabetes and kidney disease</a> are connected, according to the American Diabetes Association. Around 50% of the people that suffer from diabetes actually develop kidney problems and damage. For this reason, it is incredibly important for people that have diabetes to get checked on regularly to ensure that they are not suffering from kidney damage.</p>


<p>As you can see, there is plenty that can be done in order to ensure that you do not suffer from irreparable kidney damage. If you are someone with increased risk for kidney problems, be sure to get yourself checked on a regular basis. That way, you and your doctor will be able to spot any irregularities as they come up.</p>
