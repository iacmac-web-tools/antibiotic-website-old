<font class="print-title">Cefazolin Prophylaxis for Total Joint Arthroplasty: Obese Patients Are Frequently Underdosed and at Increased Risk of Periprosthetic Joint Infection</font><br>
<font class="print-sub">Date: 2018-11-09 09:40:00<br>Topic: Site News</font><br><br>
<font class="print-normal">One of the most effective prophylactic strategies against periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is administration of perioperative antibiotics. Many orthopedic surgeons are unaware of the weight-based dosing protocol for cefazolin. This study aimed at elucidating what proportion of patients receiving cefazolin prophylaxis are underdosed and whether this increases the risk of PJI.<hr size="1"><br>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p class="j">One of the most effective prophylactic strategies against periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is administration of perioperative antibiotics. Many orthopedic surgeons are unaware of the weight-based dosing protocol for cefazolin. This study aimed at elucidating what proportion of patients receiving cefazolin prophylaxis are underdosed and whether this increases the risk of PJI.</p>
<p><b>Methods</b></p>
<p class="j">A retrospective study of 17,393 primary total joint arthroplasties receiving cefazolin as perioperative prophylaxis from 2005 to 2017 was performed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups (underdosed and adequately dosed) based on patient weight and antibiotic dosage. Patients who developed PJI within 1 year following index procedure were identified. A&nbsp;bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to control for potential confounders and identify risk factors for PJI.</p>
<p><b>Results</b></p>
<p class="j">The majority of patients weighing greater than 120 kg (95.9%, 944/984) were underdosed. Underdosed patients had a higher rate of PJI at 1 year compared with adequately dosed patients (1.51% <i>vs</i> 0.86%, P=0.002). Patients weighing greater than 120&nbsp;kg had higher 1-year PJI rate than patients weighing less than 120 kg (3.25% <i>vs</i> 0.83%, P&lt;0.001). Patients who were underdosed (odds ratio, 1.665; P=0.006) with greater comorbidities (odds ratio, 1.259; P&lt;0.001) were more likely to develop PJI at 1 year.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="j">Cefazolin underdosing is common, especially for patients weighing more than 120&nbsp;kg. Our study reports that underdosed patients were more likely to develop PJI. Orthopedic surgeons should pay attention to the weight-based dosing of antibiotics in the perioperative period to avoid increasing risk of PJI.</p>
