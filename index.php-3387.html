V. Antimicrobial Therapy of Surgical Infection (page 2)
<hr size="1" align="left" width="320"><br>

<a name="5_10"></a><br>
<h5>Duration of treatment</h5>

<p class="aj">The treatment periods indicated in the generally accepted guidelines or specified in the relevant literature for different surgical infections must be accepted. In general, if the therapy period is too short, treatment failure could occur, if it is too long there is the danger of additional resistance developing plus increased side-effects. If the dosage is too low and the period of administration too long, the probability of developing resistance will be increased.</p>
<p class="aj">There is increasing evidence and growing consensus that short-course, adequate dose therapy is at least as effective as the prolonged (7-14 days) therapy previously administered. These shorter antimicrobial courses decrease the exposure of the patient to costly and potentially toxic agents. Reducing the length of antimicrobial therapy also minimizes exposure of bacteria to antimicrobials and therefore reduces selective pressure for the emergence of resistance.</p>
<p class="aj">There are two general approaches that limit the duration of antimicrobial therapy. One approach relies on protocols that specify the length of antimicrobial therapy based on intra-operative findings at the time of the initial surgical intervention. For example, patients with limited intra-peritoneal infections receive only 2 days of antimicrobial therapy, whereas those with more extensive peritonitis receive up to 5 days of therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">The alternative approach uses the patient's symptoms and signs to guide the duration of antimicrobial therapy. Several studies demonstrated that discontinuation of antimicrobials at the time of resolution of clinical signs was as successful as a fixed duration of antimicrobial therapy, and resulted in a shorter duration of antibiotic use. Therefore, antimicrobial therapy can be discontinued in patients when they have no clinical evidence of infection such as fever or leukocytosis.</p>
<p class="aj">It is fairly common to observe prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy being used in patients with persistent fevers or elevated white blood cell counts. Such patients are at high risk for treatment failure. The consensus opinion is that on-going clinical evidence of infection at the end of the time period designated for antimicrobial therapy should trigger a careful diagnostic search for a focus of infection elsewhere, rather than prolongation of antimicrobial therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">Antibiotic treatment of a surgical infection without this mechanical solution will not resolve the infection. It is necessary to highlight that the most important aspect of the initial approach to a surgical infection is the recognition that operative intervention is required.</p>
<p class="aj">Longer course of antimicrobial treatment is warranted in selected patients in whom optimal source control cannot be achieved, i.e. where the infective pathology cannot or has not been surgically eliminated (e.g. osteomyelitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, salpingitis, cholangitis or diverticulitis).</p>
<p class="aj">However, final decision about duration of treatment is defined by type of surgical infection (e.g. patients with large burn wounds usually require long-term courses of antimicrobial treatment, which is due to specific course of the disease).</p>

<a name="5_11"></a><br>
<h5>Incorrect approaches to antimicrobial therapy of surgical infections</h5>

<p class="aj">Longer courses of antimicrobial treatment with changing of antibiotics, especially to more potent, is a serious break of principles of their prudent use. Changing to another antibiotic is only indicated in patients whose infected site has fully excised during initial operation, but clinical signs of infection are not resolving after 72 hours of adequate antimicrobial therapy. In many cases, failure of treatment is due to resistance of actual microorganism to the empirically chosen antimicrobial regimen. Therefore, in order to change to a more effective regimen, it is essential to have culture and susceptibility data from the original infection.</p>
<p class="aj">The general administration of the antibiotics courses, especially postoperatively after &laquo;clean&raquo; and &laquo;clean-contaminated&raquo; operations, in order to &laquo;shield&raquo; a patient from the danger of an infection is not recommended. Abundant data demonstrate that this course of action is ineffective in preventing infection but does promote bacterial resistance.</p>

<a name="5_12"></a><br>
<h5>Administration of antimicrobials in the settings where microbiological diagnostics is unavailable</h5>

<p class="aj">When no local microbiology laboratory exists, antibiotic policy should be based upon a basic formulary, if possible established after consultation with regional or national expertise. When resources for microbiology are scarce, priority should be given to examination of samples from nosocomial, life-threatening cases or arrangements should be made for microbiology tests with a referral hospital. Culturing of environment or personnel should be discouraged.</p>

<a name="5_13"></a><br>
<h5>Combination antimicrobial regimen in surgical patients</h5>

<p class="aj">The possible advantages of antibiotic combinations are: a wider range of activity, a synergistic effect, delayed development of antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, the use of antibiotic combinations is only verifiable for certain situations.</p>
<p class="aj">Monotherapy is preferred over combination therapy unless compelling reasons prevail, such as drug synergy or extended spectrum beyond what can be obtained with a single drug. Monotherapy reduces the risk of drug interactions, medication errors, missed doses and side effects, and is usually less expensive than combination therapy. Since drug synergy is difficult to assess and the possibility of antagonism always exists, antibiotics should be combined for synergy only if synergy is likely based on experience or actual testing. Combination therapy is not effective in preventing antibiotic resistance, except in very few situations. Antibiotic combinations that may prevent resistance include: anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (ceftazidime) + aminoglycoside (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin) or ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p class="aj">Combination antimicrobial regimens should be administered as initial therapy when surgical infection is polymicrobial and a single antibiotic that covers all most likely pathogens is not available. One such situation is empirical therapy of surgical infection, involving gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes (e.g. <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>).</p>
<p class="aj">Obligate aerobic gram-negative rods, including <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. and <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp., are most commonly found in hospital-associated pneumonias in surgical patients but may also be recovered from the peritoneal cavity or severe soft tissue infections. These species are often antibiotic resistant and require treatment with specific antipseudomonal antibiotics such as ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin. A significant proportion of these species exhibit strains resistant even to the most effective antibiotics, and patients with such pathogens are probably best treated empirically with two antibiotics before <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i> susceptibility testing becomes available. Even after susceptibility data are known, critically ill patients may benefit from treatment with two effective agents. Bacteria from both of these genera have a tendency to develop resistance to antibiotics during therapy. Although using two agents may not reduce this process, it does leave the patient with at least one effective drug.</p>
<p class="aj">However, in the case of administration of broadest-spectrum antimicrobial (e.g. carbapenem), which covers all anticipated causative microorganisms, combining with another antibiotic (third-generation cephalosporins, metronidazole) is unjustified and increases the risk of the development of resistance and costs as well as risk for adverse drug reactions. The only exception is the directed therapy of serious infections, caused by association of microbes, including multi-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. MRSA, VRE).</p>

<a name="5_14"></a><br>
<h5>Combining of antibiotics with other drugs (NSAID, H<sub>2</sub>-blockers, immunomodulatory drugs).</h5>

<p class="aj">In practice, adding medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and H<sub>2</sub>-blockers, to antimicrobial regimens in order to increase the efficacy and safety of the latter or accelerate patient's recovery (or with other aim) is commonly observed. However, antihistamines have not been demonstrated in most clinical studies to prevent sensitization of the patient to the antigens of bacterial cells.</p>
<p class="aj">Although immunomodulatory drugs are a possible adjunctive therapy, their use should be limited to a highly selected group of immunocompromised patients. Moreover, administration of drugs modifying immune system in combination with antibiotics should not change any of the basic principles of antimicrobial therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">Since no additional benefit from the use of combinations of antibiotics with immunomodulatory drugs (or other medications mentioned above) was shown in well designed, controlled clinical studies, it should not be recommended for clinical practice. In addition, common and unreasonable use of adjunctive drugs (NSAID) is not cost-effective and increases the risk of adverse drug events.</p>

<a name="5_15"></a><br>
<h5>Selective decontamination of the digestive tract</h5>

<p class="aj">Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) was developed as an attempt to reduce the incidence of morbidity and mortality resulting from nosocomial infection by gram-negative aerobic bacilli (GNAB) in patients treated in the ICU. The intention was to remove the GNAB and yeasts from the oropharynx and upper and lower gastrointestinal tract using non-absorbable antibiotics, thus reducing the colonization and infection of the tissues by these organisms.</p>
<p class="aj">Most organisms causing postoperative wound and other nosocomial infections arise from the gastrointestinal tract. Certainly the organisms responsible for the development of septicemia, multiple organ failure and overwhelming sepsis would appear to derive from the colon, which has been described as the &laquo;monitor&raquo; of multiple organ failure. The colonic flora contains both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, which act synergistically to produce postoperative intra-abdominal infections. Preoperative eradication of the anaerobic bacteria from the colon would probably not be possible in view of the large number of organisms involved, and is not desirable because of the influence these organisms have on colonization resistance. However, the smaller number of gram-negative aerobic bacilli in the colon can be eradicated, or greatly suppressed, by standard SDD therapy (non-absorbable antibiotics given orally and/or rectally) or by use of fluoroquinolones, and thus rendered unable to cause infection by direct contamination of the tissues, by synergy with anaerobic organisms or by bacterial translocation. This approach has been favorably assessed in cardiopulmonary bypass operations, esophageal surgery, liver transplantation, small-bowel transplantation and in colorectal surgery. However, conclusive evidence for the benefit of SDD in any of these settings has not been produced, so this approach is not recommended for routine surgical practice.</p>

<a name="5_16"></a><br>
<h5>Rotation of antibiotics in hospital</h5>

<p class="aj">The concept of antibiotic class rotation has been advocated as a potential strategy for reducing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. In theory, a class of antibiotics or a specific antibiotic drug is withdrawn from use for a defined time period and reintroduced at a later point in time in an attempt to limit bacterial resistance to the cycled antimicrobial agents.</p>
<p class="aj">Quarterly rotation of empirical antibiotics may be an effective way to combat morbidity and mortality from antibiotic-resistant surgical infections in ICUs. Antibiotic rotation is associated with a marked decrease in the rate of resistant gram-positive coccal and gram-negative bacillary infections. Mortality related to infection is also reduced in the patients given rotated antibiotics.</p>
<p class="aj">Antibiotic selection in the rotation schedule is based on the isolated bacterial pathogens along with their susceptibilities and is performed on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="aj">The influence of a scheduled antibiotic class change on the incidence of nosocomial infections was examined among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The overall incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was significantly reduced with the introduction of ciprofloxacin, after 6-month baseline time period, during which the traditional practice of prescribing a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime) for the empiric treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. This was primarily due to a significant reduction in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Similarly, a lower incidence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteremia was observed.</p>
<p class="aj">Rotation of antibiotics is most likely to be effective for limited periods in closed environments, such as ICUs, but this approach requires careful microbiologic monitoring because of the monotonic selective pressure of a single agent and the possible emergence of resistance to unrelated classes of drugs caused by genetic linkage of resistance mechanisms. As the size of the patient population under study increases, availability of various classes of drugs may be more effective at reducing the risk of emergence of resistance and may be a better strategy than rotation.</p>

<a name="5_17"></a><br>
<h5>Use of antibiotics in ambulatory surgery</h5>

<p class="aj">In the near future, many surgical patients, including certain patients with surgical infections, will probably be treated in ambulatory surgical centers or in outpatient settings. In general, there are no differences between surgical care being given in both these settings. This is why the basic established principles of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis and appropriate antimicrobial treatment are similar in all surgical patients and independent of place of treatment. However, some distinctions concerning the choice of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of ambulatory surgical patients can be made:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>Antimicrobial resistant microorganisms (MRSA, VRE, <i>P.aeruginosa</i>, etc.) are isolated from ambulatory surgical patients more rarely than in hospitalized patients. Because of this, conventional, less expensive drugs can be as effective for treatment of surgical infections in outpatients as newer antibiotics.</li>
  <li>In outpatient settings most patients should be treated efficiently with oral antimicrobials.</li>
</ul>

<a name="5_18"></a><br>
<h5>Place of antifungal drugs in surgery</h5>

<p class="aj">Pathogens such as <i>Candida</i>&nbsp;spp. may be seen frequently as an opportunistic invader in patients with serious surgical infections who have received broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment suppressing normal endogenous flora.</p>
<p class="aj">Predisposing factors for fungal infections are well known and include leukemia, lymphoma, bone marrow or solid organ transplant, diabetes, severe burns, premature birth, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs, broad-spectrum antibiotics, indwelling catheters, prolonged hospitalization, total parenteral nutrition. Independent risk factors for nosocomial fungemia include prior treatment with multiple antibiotics, prior catheterization, isolation of <i>Candida</i> species from sites other than the blood, prior hemodialysis, azotemia, recent major abdominal surgery, prolonged hospital stay, severity of acute illness, candiduria, large burns, and prematurity.</p>
<p class="aj"><i>Candida</i> species recovered from open wounds usually represent contamination, not true invasion. Isolation of <i>Candida</i> species from peptic ulcer perforations also does not usually require treatment. Intra-abdominal Candida infections are more common in association with infections after severe pancreatitis. This may be due to the common use of broad spectrum antibiotics for long periods of time in patients with pancreatitis and to the frequent use of repeated abdominal operations with open wounds and drains. Recovery of <i>Candida</i> from an established intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis or from urine and sputum in an otherwise compromised patient may warrant antifungal therapy. Surgical patients with fungal colonization of multiple sites, with fungi in a well-drained abscess or candidal peritonitis can be managed successfully with total doses of amphotericin&nbsp;B. Although there are fewer data regarding the efficacy of fluconazole in treating surgical <i>Candida</i> infections, there are reports of its successful use. However, there is some controversy regarding the adequacy of fluconazole for the treatment of established candidal infections in the peritoneal cavity, and some authorities recommend amphotericin B as the preferred agent instead of fluconazole for these patients. Ultimately, the choice of antifungal therapy will be heavily influenced by the risks of toxicity in a given patient and the patient's renal function at the time of beginning antifungal therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">Antifungal drugs should also be administered to any patient with at least a single blood culture positive for <i>Candida</i>&nbsp;spp., i.e. even single episode of fungemia in the postoperative period. Clinical trials have shown that such patients more frequently develop systemic complications associated with fungi than patients without candidemia. Successful therapy for serious systemic Candida infections requires starting antifungal therapy as early as possible. Treatment should be initiated as soon as adequate cultures are obtained. Amphotericin&nbsp;B or its lipid and liposomal formulations are recommended for managing systemic candidal infections, particularly if renal function is compromised.</p>
<p class="aj">It is important to note that as is the case with antibacterial agents, the increasing use of antifungal agents has led to the development of antifungal resistance, the most clinically important of which is the resistance of <i>Candida</i> to fluconazole.</p>
