<h3 class="c">V. Antimicrobial Therapy of Surgical Infection</h3>

<h5>Distinction between antibiotic prophylaxis and antimicrobial treatment in surgery</h5>

<p class="aj">It is important to distinguish prophylactic from therapeutic indications for antibiotics, because this will influence the duration of administration as well as the antibiotic selection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is only recommended for perioperative prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis should not be extended beyond 24&nbsp;h following surgery, because it does not pertain to prevention of SSI caused by postoperative contamination. Inappropriately extended (prolonged) use of prophylactic antibiotics leads to the development of bacterial resistance and may also mask the signs of established infections, making diagnosis more difficult.</p>
<p class="aj">In contrast, therapeutic antimicrobial treatment usually begins preoperatively, lasts for more than 24&nbsp;h after operation and aimed to treat <u>established</u> surgical infections.</p>

<a name="5_2"></a><br>
<h5>Indications for antimicrobial treatment in surgical patients</h5>

<p class="aj">Therapeutic antimicrobials should be administered to the patients with surgical site infection or established surgical infection, which occurred before the operation.</p>
<p class="aj">Decision about administration of therapeutic antimicrobials should be made based on traditional classification of SSI and clinical picture. Indeed, in most superficial incisional SSI without evidence of systemic inflammatory response, antimicrobial treatment is unnecessary. In contrast, deep incisional and organ/space SSI as well as any SSI with systemic signs of infection should be treated with therapeutic antimicrobials.</p>
<p class="aj">It is necessary to emphasize that the initial approach to an area of wound infection is to obtain a relevant clinical specimen. The only definitive treatment for an infected wound is to drain it. Antibiotics are indicated only as an adjunct to surgical drainage if there is evidence of systemic infection.</p>

<a name="5_3"></a><br>
<h5>When therapeutic antimicrobial treatment rather than antibiotic prophylaxis should be performed?</h5>

<p class="aj">The use of antibiotics in almost all &laquo;contaminated&raquo; and &laquo;dirty&raquo; operations is considered as therapeutic rather than prophylaxis. In these cases antimicrobial treatment is usually administered preoperatively and continues for more than 24 h following surgical intervention.</p>
<p class="aj">With regard to primary surgical infection, patients in whom infection has extended beyond the initial anatomic focus should be given therapeutic antimicrobials for greater than 24&nbsp;h. In contrast, patients with a fully removable focus of infection or inflammation, i.e. localized limited infection, should be treated with prophylactic antimicrobials for 24&nbsp;h or less. Intra-operative confirmation of the infection (e.g. patients who have intra-operative findings of purulent or infected peritoneal fluid) is an absolute indication for therapeutic antimicrobial therapy, since these patients considered as having established surgical infection.</p>
<p class="aj">Although the distinction between therapeutic and prophylactic use of antimicrobials is usually apparent, there are patients in whom antimicrobial use falls into a &laquo;gray area&raquo;. For example, antimicrobials given for 24&nbsp;h or less are adequate for many patients with traumatic bowel perforations, iatrogenic bowel perforations (endoscopic perforations of the colon or enterotomies occurring during surgical inter-ventions) and gastroduodenal perforations operated on immediately. However, the consensus opinion is that patients with small bowel or colon perforations greater than 12&nbsp;h old, or gastroduodenal perforations greater than 24&nbsp;h old, have established intra-abdominal infections and should be treated with therapeutic antimicrobials.</p>
<p class="aj">One of the main tasks of antibiotic committee is to make for different fields of surgery clear recommendations on indications for antimicrobial prophylaxis/treatment based on highly scientific evident data from well-designed clinical trials.</p>

<a name="5_4"></a><br>
<h5>General principles of antimicrobial therapy of surgical infection</h5>

<p class="aj">When prescribing therapeutic antmicrobials every surgeon should adhere to the following guidelines to treat patients effectively and contain antimicrobial resistance:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>Select an antibiotic to which the known pathogen is likely to be fully sensitive (it is more advantageous to use a narrow-spectrum antibiotic where available);</li>
  <li>Restrict the use of antibiotics to which resistance is developing (or has developed);</li>
  <li>Antibiotics used systemically should not be used topically;</li>
  <li>The antibiotic should be given in full dose by the appropriate route and at correct intervals;</li>
  <li>Side effects should be known and monitored;</li>
  <li>Expensive antibiotics should not be used if equally effective and cheaper alternatives are suitable.</li>
</ul>

<a name="5_5"></a><br>
<h5>Empirical and directed antimicrobial therapy</h5>

<p class="aj">A distinction must be made between <u>specific (directed) therapy</u> and <u>empirical therapy</u>.</p>
<p class="aj">When the cause of the disease is unknown, an empirical therapy is guided by the site and type of infection and the anticipated range of pathogens. Antibiotics should be administered (alone or in combinations) which</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>cover this range of pathogens;</li>
  <li>have the highest chances of success with a narrow range of activity and;</li>
  <li>from which minimal adverse reactions can be expected.</li>
</ul>
<p class="aj">Once the germ and the antibiogram are known, changing to an antibiotic with a narrow range of activity becomes possible. This helps to minimize the side effects, to reduce the selection pressure and to save costs. With known causes of infection and possibly with a known antibiogram, the antibiotic will be selected for a specific therapy that has the highest chances of success, with a narrow range of activity and minimal side effects.</p>

<a name="5_6"></a><br>
<h5>Route of administration</h5>

<p class="aj">Parenteral (intramuscular and intravenous) and oral routes of administration of antimicrobials are only adequate in surgical patients.</p>
<p class="aj">Intravenous administration has the advantage that high blood and tissue levels can be achieved quickly. This is why serious and life-threatening surgical infections require intravenous antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">As soon as the clinical situation permits, conversion from intravenous to oral administration should be the aim. Oral application is, however, not recommended in cases of unconsciousness, vomiting, dysphagia and gastrointestinal diseases.</p>
<p class="aj">Another routes of administration of antibiotics shows unreliable results and should therefore be avoided as far as possible.</p>
<p class="aj">Antibiotics irrigated into peritoneal cavity during the surgery will not achieve optimal tissue concentrations at the site of infection. Increasing their concentrations may lead to the development of systemic adverse effects.</p>

<a name="5_7"></a><br>
<h5>Local use of antimicrobials</h5>

<p class="aj">The use of topical antibiotics often effectively diminishes the incidence of infection in contaminated wounds. However, the combination of topical agents and parenteral agents is not more effective than either one alone, and topical agents alone are inferior to parenteral agents. As a general rule, topical agents do not cause any harm if one adheres to the following rules: (1) do not use any agent in wounds or in the abdomen that would not be suitable for parenteral administration; and (2) do not use more of the agent than would be acceptable for parenteral administration. In considering the amount used, any drug being given parenterally must be added to the amount being placed in the wound. Topical agents used for burn wounds may be used in large open wounds in selected patients.</p>
<p class="aj">With the exception of burn wounds, local application of antimicrobial agents (intra-incisional injection, injection into drainage tubes, intra-operative irrigation of the cavities, etc.) for prophylaxis or treatment of SSI is faulty surgical practice and inferior to antibiotics given parenterally. Most antimicrobials have been shown to be destroyed by debris and bacterial toxins and enzymes. When applied locally, systemic antibiotics are not establishing optimal bactericidial concentrations in the infected site and surrounding tissues, resulting in the development antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<a name="5_8"></a><br>
<h5>De-escalation therapy</h5>

<p class="aj">De-escalation therapy is a treatment strategy that works on the principle that the best possible regimen for critically ill patients with serious infections is empiric therapy with a broad-spectrum agent that provides full coverage of all identified pathogens. This is done to avoid the high mortality associated with inadequate antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">Inadequate initial antibiotic therapy is a major risk factor for mortality in serious bacterial infections, particularly in hospital-acquired ones. Initial appropriate therapy is therefore an important determinant of outcome in these patients. Appropriate therapy is defined as the use of at least one antibiotic to which all isolates were susceptible <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i> from the moment in which culture was obtained. De-escalation therapy is an approach &laquo;to balance the need to provide adequate initial antibiotic treatment of high-risk patients with the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic use that promotes resistance&raquo;.</p>
<p class="aj">There are two stages in the process of de-escalation therapy. The first stage involves administering the broadest-spectrum antibiotic. The concept is that a broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is effective against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria needs to be administered as soon as infection is suspected. This is done to decrease mortality, prevent organ dysfunction and decrease hospital length of stay. Of course, it is very important for every institution to have local, current microbiological data in order to assess the likely infecting pathogens and the susceptibility patterns.</p>
<p class="aj">The second stage focuses on de-escalating the antibiotic therapy in order to minimize the possibility of resistant pathogens developing and in order to provide a more cost-effective treatment. Once initial culture results and bacterial sensitivity profiles become available after a relatively short period of time (i.e. 24 to 72&nbsp;h), it is possible to de-escalate (narrow) the regimen, or even discontinue it if necessary. Meanwhile, the economic burden, unnecessarily long duration of therapy, selective pressures, which can cause antibiotic resistance, morbidity, and mortality associated with inadequate antibiotic therapy can be avoided.</p>
<p>The general principles when considering de-escalating are:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>Identify the organism and know its susceptibilities;</li>
  <li>Assess and potentially modify initial selection of antibiotics based on organism susceptibility report;</li>
  <li>Make the decision in the context of patient improvement on the initial regimen;</li>
  <li>Individualize the duration of therapy based on patient's factors and clinical response.</li>
</ul>

<a name="5_9"></a><br>
<h5>Sequential therapy in surgery</h5>

<p class="aj">The modern and promising approach to rationalize use of antimicrobials in hospital is sequential therapy. The aim of this strategy is to reduce costs associated with the use of antimicrobial and minimize length of hospital stay without detriment to efficacy and quality of medical care. Sequential therapy (step-down therapy, switch therapy, follow-on therapy) is defined as two-stage use of antibiotics when initial intravenous antimicrobial therapy is switched to the same or another oral antibiotic as soon as patient's condition improves and he/she is able to take medications orally.</p>
<p class="aj">Most infectious diseases should be treated orally, unless the patient is critically ill, cannot take antibiotics by mouth, or there is no equivalent oral antibiotic. If the patient is able to take/absorb oral antibiotics, there is no difference in clinical outcome using equivalent IV or PO antibiotics. It is more important to think in terms of antibiotic spectrum, bioavailability and tissue penetration, rather than route of administration. Nearly all non-critically ill patients should be treated in part or entirely with oral antibiotics. When switching from IV to PO therapy, the oral antibiotic chosen ideally should achieve the same blood and tissue levels as the equivalent IV antibiotic.</p>
<p class="aj">It is important not to have the conversion to oral therapy result in courses of antimicrobial therapy that extend longer than would otherwise have been done with parenteral therapy alone. Most patients can have their antibiotics stopped when they have demonstrated some clinical improvement and the temperature and white blood cell count have returned to normal or at least improved. Continuing antibiotics beyond this time is not necessary.</p>
<p class="aj">In spite of clear advantages of sequential therapy, it moves into clinical practice, especially surgery, very slowly. Up to 75% of hospitalized patients with different types of infection could be converted from parenteral to oral antibiotics. Controlled clinical trials of sequential therapy have confirmed its efficacy in patients with urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and osteomyelitis. Thus, the use of oral antibiotics to complete the antimicrobial course in patients with intra-abdominal infections seems reasonable based on evident data from randomized prospective clinical studies. Conversion from intravenous to oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was found equivalent to a mandatory intravenous regimen in some clinical trials of intra-abdominal infections.</p>

V. Antimicrobial Therapy of Surgical Infection (page 2)
<hr size="1" align="left" width="320"><br>

<a name="5_10"></a><br>
<h5>Duration of treatment</h5>

<p class="aj">The treatment periods indicated in the generally accepted guidelines or specified in the relevant literature for different surgical infections must be accepted. In general, if the therapy period is too short, treatment failure could occur, if it is too long there is the danger of additional resistance developing plus increased side-effects. If the dosage is too low and the period of administration too long, the probability of developing resistance will be increased.</p>
<p class="aj">There is increasing evidence and growing consensus that short-course, adequate dose therapy is at least as effective as the prolonged (7-14 days) therapy previously administered. These shorter antimicrobial courses decrease the exposure of the patient to costly and potentially toxic agents. Reducing the length of antimicrobial therapy also minimizes exposure of bacteria to antimicrobials and therefore reduces selective pressure for the emergence of resistance.</p>
<p class="aj">There are two general approaches that limit the duration of antimicrobial therapy. One approach relies on protocols that specify the length of antimicrobial therapy based on intra-operative findings at the time of the initial surgical intervention. For example, patients with limited intra-peritoneal infections receive only 2 days of antimicrobial therapy, whereas those with more extensive peritonitis receive up to 5 days of therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">The alternative approach uses the patient's symptoms and signs to guide the duration of antimicrobial therapy. Several studies demonstrated that discontinuation of antimicrobials at the time of resolution of clinical signs was as successful as a fixed duration of antimicrobial therapy, and resulted in a shorter duration of antibiotic use. Therefore, antimicrobial therapy can be discontinued in patients when they have no clinical evidence of infection such as fever or leukocytosis.</p>
<p class="aj">It is fairly common to observe prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy being used in patients with persistent fevers or elevated white blood cell counts. Such patients are at high risk for treatment failure. The consensus opinion is that on-going clinical evidence of infection at the end of the time period designated for antimicrobial therapy should trigger a careful diagnostic search for a focus of infection elsewhere, rather than prolongation of antimicrobial therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">Antibiotic treatment of a surgical infection without this mechanical solution will not resolve the infection. It is necessary to highlight that the most important aspect of the initial approach to a surgical infection is the recognition that operative intervention is required.</p>
<p class="aj">Longer course of antimicrobial treatment is warranted in selected patients in whom optimal source control cannot be achieved, i.e. where the infective pathology cannot or has not been surgically eliminated (e.g. osteomyelitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, salpingitis, cholangitis or diverticulitis).</p>
<p class="aj">However, final decision about duration of treatment is defined by type of surgical infection (e.g. patients with large burn wounds usually require long-term courses of antimicrobial treatment, which is due to specific course of the disease).</p>

<a name="5_11"></a><br>
<h5>Incorrect approaches to antimicrobial therapy of surgical infections</h5>

<p class="aj">Longer courses of antimicrobial treatment with changing of antibiotics, especially to more potent, is a serious break of principles of their prudent use. Changing to another antibiotic is only indicated in patients whose infected site has fully excised during initial operation, but clinical signs of infection are not resolving after 72 hours of adequate antimicrobial therapy. In many cases, failure of treatment is due to resistance of actual microorganism to the empirically chosen antimicrobial regimen. Therefore, in order to change to a more effective regimen, it is essential to have culture and susceptibility data from the original infection.</p>
<p class="aj">The general administration of the antibiotics courses, especially postoperatively after &laquo;clean&raquo; and &laquo;clean-contaminated&raquo; operations, in order to &laquo;shield&raquo; a patient from the danger of an infection is not recommended. Abundant data demonstrate that this course of action is ineffective in preventing infection but does promote bacterial resistance.</p>

<a name="5_12"></a><br>
<h5>Administration of antimicrobials in the settings where microbiological diagnostics is unavailable</h5>

<p class="aj">When no local microbiology laboratory exists, antibiotic policy should be based upon a basic formulary, if possible established after consultation with regional or national expertise. When resources for microbiology are scarce, priority should be given to examination of samples from nosocomial, life-threatening cases or arrangements should be made for microbiology tests with a referral hospital. Culturing of environment or personnel should be discouraged.</p>

<a name="5_13"></a><br>
<h5>Combination antimicrobial regimen in surgical patients</h5>

<p class="aj">The possible advantages of antibiotic combinations are: a wider range of activity, a synergistic effect, delayed development of antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, the use of antibiotic combinations is only verifiable for certain situations.</p>
<p class="aj">Monotherapy is preferred over combination therapy unless compelling reasons prevail, such as drug synergy or extended spectrum beyond what can be obtained with a single drug. Monotherapy reduces the risk of drug interactions, medication errors, missed doses and side effects, and is usually less expensive than combination therapy. Since drug synergy is difficult to assess and the possibility of antagonism always exists, antibiotics should be combined for synergy only if synergy is likely based on experience or actual testing. Combination therapy is not effective in preventing antibiotic resistance, except in very few situations. Antibiotic combinations that may prevent resistance include: anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (ceftazidime) + aminoglycoside (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin) or ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p class="aj">Combination antimicrobial regimens should be administered as initial therapy when surgical infection is polymicrobial and a single antibiotic that covers all most likely pathogens is not available. One such situation is empirical therapy of surgical infection, involving gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes (e.g. <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>).</p>
<p class="aj">Obligate aerobic gram-negative rods, including <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. and <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp., are most commonly found in hospital-associated pneumonias in surgical patients but may also be recovered from the peritoneal cavity or severe soft tissue infections. These species are often antibiotic resistant and require treatment with specific antipseudomonal antibiotics such as ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin. A significant proportion of these species exhibit strains resistant even to the most effective antibiotics, and patients with such pathogens are probably best treated empirically with two antibiotics before <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i> susceptibility testing becomes available. Even after susceptibility data are known, critically ill patients may benefit from treatment with two effective agents. Bacteria from both of these genera have a tendency to develop resistance to antibiotics during therapy. Although using two agents may not reduce this process, it does leave the patient with at least one effective drug.</p>
<p class="aj">However, in the case of administration of broadest-spectrum antimicrobial (e.g. carbapenem), which covers all anticipated causative microorganisms, combining with another antibiotic (third-generation cephalosporins, metronidazole) is unjustified and increases the risk of the development of resistance and costs as well as risk for adverse drug reactions. The only exception is the directed therapy of serious infections, caused by association of microbes, including multi-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. MRSA, VRE).</p>

<a name="5_14"></a><br>
<h5>Combining of antibiotics with other drugs (NSAID, H<sub>2</sub>-blockers, immunomodulatory drugs).</h5>

<p class="aj">In practice, adding medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and H<sub>2</sub>-blockers, to antimicrobial regimens in order to increase the efficacy and safety of the latter or accelerate patient's recovery (or with other aim) is commonly observed. However, antihistamines have not been demonstrated in most clinical studies to prevent sensitization of the patient to the antigens of bacterial cells.</p>
<p class="aj">Although immunomodulatory drugs are a possible adjunctive therapy, their use should be limited to a highly selected group of immunocompromised patients. Moreover, administration of drugs modifying immune system in combination with antibiotics should not change any of the basic principles of antimicrobial therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">Since no additional benefit from the use of combinations of antibiotics with immunomodulatory drugs (or other medications mentioned above) was shown in well designed, controlled clinical studies, it should not be recommended for clinical practice. In addition, common and unreasonable use of adjunctive drugs (NSAID) is not cost-effective and increases the risk of adverse drug events.</p>

<a name="5_15"></a><br>
<h5>Selective decontamination of the digestive tract</h5>

<p class="aj">Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) was developed as an attempt to reduce the incidence of morbidity and mortality resulting from nosocomial infection by gram-negative aerobic bacilli (GNAB) in patients treated in the ICU. The intention was to remove the GNAB and yeasts from the oropharynx and upper and lower gastrointestinal tract using non-absorbable antibiotics, thus reducing the colonization and infection of the tissues by these organisms.</p>
<p class="aj">Most organisms causing postoperative wound and other nosocomial infections arise from the gastrointestinal tract. Certainly the organisms responsible for the development of septicemia, multiple organ failure and overwhelming sepsis would appear to derive from the colon, which has been described as the &laquo;monitor&raquo; of multiple organ failure. The colonic flora contains both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, which act synergistically to produce postoperative intra-abdominal infections. Preoperative eradication of the anaerobic bacteria from the colon would probably not be possible in view of the large number of organisms involved, and is not desirable because of the influence these organisms have on colonization resistance. However, the smaller number of gram-negative aerobic bacilli in the colon can be eradicated, or greatly suppressed, by standard SDD therapy (non-absorbable antibiotics given orally and/or rectally) or by use of fluoroquinolones, and thus rendered unable to cause infection by direct contamination of the tissues, by synergy with anaerobic organisms or by bacterial translocation. This approach has been favorably assessed in cardiopulmonary bypass operations, esophageal surgery, liver transplantation, small-bowel transplantation and in colorectal surgery. However, conclusive evidence for the benefit of SDD in any of these settings has not been produced, so this approach is not recommended for routine surgical practice.</p>

<a name="5_16"></a><br>
<h5>Rotation of antibiotics in hospital</h5>

<p class="aj">The concept of antibiotic class rotation has been advocated as a potential strategy for reducing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. In theory, a class of antibiotics or a specific antibiotic drug is withdrawn from use for a defined time period and reintroduced at a later point in time in an attempt to limit bacterial resistance to the cycled antimicrobial agents.</p>
<p class="aj">Quarterly rotation of empirical antibiotics may be an effective way to combat morbidity and mortality from antibiotic-resistant surgical infections in ICUs. Antibiotic rotation is associated with a marked decrease in the rate of resistant gram-positive coccal and gram-negative bacillary infections. Mortality related to infection is also reduced in the patients given rotated antibiotics.</p>
<p class="aj">Antibiotic selection in the rotation schedule is based on the isolated bacterial pathogens along with their susceptibilities and is performed on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="aj">The influence of a scheduled antibiotic class change on the incidence of nosocomial infections was examined among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The overall incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was significantly reduced with the introduction of ciprofloxacin, after 6-month baseline time period, during which the traditional practice of prescribing a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime) for the empiric treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. This was primarily due to a significant reduction in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Similarly, a lower incidence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteremia was observed.</p>
<p class="aj">Rotation of antibiotics is most likely to be effective for limited periods in closed environments, such as ICUs, but this approach requires careful microbiologic monitoring because of the monotonic selective pressure of a single agent and the possible emergence of resistance to unrelated classes of drugs caused by genetic linkage of resistance mechanisms. As the size of the patient population under study increases, availability of various classes of drugs may be more effective at reducing the risk of emergence of resistance and may be a better strategy than rotation.</p>

<a name="5_17"></a><br>
<h5>Use of antibiotics in ambulatory surgery</h5>

<p class="aj">In the near future, many surgical patients, including certain patients with surgical infections, will probably be treated in ambulatory surgical centers or in outpatient settings. In general, there are no differences between surgical care being given in both these settings. This is why the basic established principles of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis and appropriate antimicrobial treatment are similar in all surgical patients and independent of place of treatment. However, some distinctions concerning the choice of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of ambulatory surgical patients can be made:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>Antimicrobial resistant microorganisms (MRSA, VRE, <i>P.aeruginosa</i>, etc.) are isolated from ambulatory surgical patients more rarely than in hospitalized patients. Because of this, conventional, less expensive drugs can be as effective for treatment of surgical infections in outpatients as newer antibiotics.</li>
  <li>In outpatient settings most patients should be treated efficiently with oral antimicrobials.</li>
</ul>

<a name="5_18"></a><br>
<h5>Place of antifungal drugs in surgery</h5>

<p class="aj">Pathogens such as <i>Candida</i>&nbsp;spp. may be seen frequently as an opportunistic invader in patients with serious surgical infections who have received broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment suppressing normal endogenous flora.</p>
<p class="aj">Predisposing factors for fungal infections are well known and include leukemia, lymphoma, bone marrow or solid organ transplant, diabetes, severe burns, premature birth, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs, broad-spectrum antibiotics, indwelling catheters, prolonged hospitalization, total parenteral nutrition. Independent risk factors for nosocomial fungemia include prior treatment with multiple antibiotics, prior catheterization, isolation of <i>Candida</i> species from sites other than the blood, prior hemodialysis, azotemia, recent major abdominal surgery, prolonged hospital stay, severity of acute illness, candiduria, large burns, and prematurity.</p>
<p class="aj"><i>Candida</i> species recovered from open wounds usually represent contamination, not true invasion. Isolation of <i>Candida</i> species from peptic ulcer perforations also does not usually require treatment. Intra-abdominal Candida infections are more common in association with infections after severe pancreatitis. This may be due to the common use of broad spectrum antibiotics for long periods of time in patients with pancreatitis and to the frequent use of repeated abdominal operations with open wounds and drains. Recovery of <i>Candida</i> from an established intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis or from urine and sputum in an otherwise compromised patient may warrant antifungal therapy. Surgical patients with fungal colonization of multiple sites, with fungi in a well-drained abscess or candidal peritonitis can be managed successfully with total doses of amphotericin&nbsp;B. Although there are fewer data regarding the efficacy of fluconazole in treating surgical <i>Candida</i> infections, there are reports of its successful use. However, there is some controversy regarding the adequacy of fluconazole for the treatment of established candidal infections in the peritoneal cavity, and some authorities recommend amphotericin B as the preferred agent instead of fluconazole for these patients. Ultimately, the choice of antifungal therapy will be heavily influenced by the risks of toxicity in a given patient and the patient's renal function at the time of beginning antifungal therapy.</p>
<p class="aj">Antifungal drugs should also be administered to any patient with at least a single blood culture positive for <i>Candida</i>&nbsp;spp., i.e. even single episode of fungemia in the postoperative period. Clinical trials have shown that such patients more frequently develop systemic complications associated with fungi than patients without candidemia. Successful therapy for serious systemic Candida infections requires starting antifungal therapy as early as possible. Treatment should be initiated as soon as adequate cultures are obtained. Amphotericin&nbsp;B or its lipid and liposomal formulations are recommended for managing systemic candidal infections, particularly if renal function is compromised.</p>
<p class="aj">It is important to note that as is the case with antibacterial agents, the increasing use of antifungal agents has led to the development of antifungal resistance, the most clinically important of which is the resistance of <i>Candida</i> to fluconazole.</p>
