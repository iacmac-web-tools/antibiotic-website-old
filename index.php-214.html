<h5>Conducted projects </h5>

<ul>
  <li><p class="j"><font class="pn-title">NPRS</font> - Nosocomial gram-negative bacteria Prevalence and Resistance Survey in units with intensive use of antimicrobials (mainly in ICUs). The prevalence of nosocomial gram-negative pathogens was evaluated and minimal inhibitory concentrations of 12 antimicrobials from different groups (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones) were determined by E-tests. There were three phases of the study.</p>
<p class="j"><b>Phase&nbsp;I</b> began in 1994. There were 3 participating centers: Scientific Center of Surgery and State Research Center of Antibiotics in Moscow and State Medical Academy in Smolensk. A total of 300 gram-negative nosocomial strains were studied and analyzed.</p>
<p class="j"><b>Phase&nbsp;II</b> of the survey was carried out in 1995-1996 in 10 centers: Moscow (2 centers), St-Petersburg, Nizhnij Novgorod, Krasnodar, Ekaterinburg, Kazan, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk. A total of 1005 gram-negative nosocomial strains were collected. An Information Bulletin (&laquo;Current status of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative nosocomial bacteria in ICUs&raquo;) was published joined with Interdepartmental Scientific Board on hospital-acquired infections of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and Ministry of Health of Russian Federation, also data were presented as an article in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infection (<a target="_blank" href="en/ar/pub/aerobic.shtml">J&nbsp;Clin Microbiol Infect 1998; 4:497-507</a>). <a target="_blank" href="en/ar/pub/bogd.shtml">[Poster]</a></p>
<p class="j"><b>Phase&nbsp;III</b> was carried out in 1997-2000 in 28 ICUs from 15 centers of different regions of Russia including Moscow (9 centers), St-Petersburg (3 centers), Smolensk, Ryazan, Nizhnij Novgorod, Krasnodar (2 centers), Stavropol, Kazan (2 centers), Ekaterinburg (2 centers), Tomsk, Novosibirsk, Ufa, Omsk, Krasnoyarsk (2 centers), Vladivostok. A total of 2664 aerobic NGNB were isolated. Recommendations for the Ministry of Health for optimization of antimicrobial chemotherapy of gram-negative nosocomial infections are developed. Results of the study are presented at the 41st Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Chicago, USA <a href="en/ar/pub/p007-67.shtml">[Poster&nbsp;007/67]</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p class="j">Survey of antimicrobial resistance in <i>Shigella flexneri</i> and <i>S.sonnei</i>. A total of 200 Shigella spp strains were isolated during 1998-1999 in two centers of Smolensk region <a href="en/ar/pub/1214.shtml">[Poster&nbsp;1241]</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p class="j"><b>UTIAP</b> - multicenter prospective surveillance of bacterial etiology of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial resistance of urinary tract pathogens in adults.</p>
<p class="j">In 1998 in the frame of phase I 299 gram-negative bacteria isolated from outpatients with acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) were collected from the 4 Russian centers in Moscow (2 centers), Smolensk and Novosibirsk <a href="en/ar/pub/p0344.shtml">[Poster&nbsp;P0344]</a>.</p>
<p class="j">During phase II both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs were studied. Four centers in Ekaterinburg, Rostov-na-Donu, Saint-Petersburg and Smolensk took part in this study providing a total of 295 strains of urinary pathogens.</p>
<p class="j">Strains from both phases were evaluated for the resistance to 10 antimicrobials commonly used for the treatment of UTIs: ampicillin, gentamicin, trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, pipemidic and nalidixic acids, niroxolin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.</p></li>

  <li><p class="j"><b>ARMID-2000</b> - Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens in children. During that study in 11 centers from different parts of Russia (Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Smolensk, Kazan, Ekaterinburg, Orenburg, Irkutsk, Nizhnij Novgorod) a total of 770 strains were collected. Minimal inhibitor concentrations of 21 antimicrobials (including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, co-trimoxazole, nitroxoline, fosfomycine, nitrofuranoine) were determined using agar dilution method.</p></li>

<h5>On-going projects</h5>

<ul class="txt">
  <li><p class="j"><b>ARGon</b> - surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance in <i>N.gonorrhoeae</i> (Antibiotic Resistance in GONococci) is intended to determine the level of antimicrobial resistance in <i>N.gonorrhoeae</i>. It is the pilot study of such kind in Russia. Susceptibility of 100 strains isolated from ambulatory patients was determined to penicillin G, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone. On the base of obtained results an Information Bulletin &laquo;Antibiotic Susceptibility of Gonococci and the Optimum treatment of gonococcal infection&raquo; was issued in 1998 by the IACMAC in collaboration with Russian Association for Prophylaxis of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, results of the study was also presented on 21 Interntional congress on Chemotherapy, Birmingham, 4-7 July 1999. <a href="en/ar/pub/p188.shtml">[Poster&nbsp;P188]</a></p>
<p class="j">The antimicrobial resistance monitoring of <i>N.gonorrhoeae</i> will be proceeded in several geographically separated areas of Russia. On the time being 150 strains from Moscow and Smolensk are collected.</p></li>

  <li><p class="j"><b>PeGASus</b> is the first multicenter prospective study of the antibiotic resistance in of the common pathogens causing upper respiratory tract infections (<i>S.pneumoniae</i>, <i>H.influenzae</i> and <i>S.pyogenes</i>) in Russia started in 1998. It involves 18 participating microbiological laboratories in 12 cities of various Russian regions including Moscow (6 centers), St-Petersburg (2 centers), Kazan, Ekaterinburg (2 centers), Omsk, Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Krasnodar, Smolensk, Nizhnij Novgorod, Ryazan, Ufa and total of 500 strains were collected and studied.</p></li>

  <li><p class="j"><b>CRoChA</b> (&laquo;<b>Baby</b>&raquo;) - the study of nasopharyngeal carriage of <i>S.pneumoniae</i> and <i>H.influenzae</i> in healthy children attending day care centers. The rate of nasopharyngeal carriage of <i>S.pneumoniae</i> and <i>H.influenzae</i> in healthy children attending day-care centers in Moscow, Smolensk and Yartcevo (Smolensk region) was studied and the antimicrobial resistance determined in 1997-1998.</p>
<p class="j">A total of 733 children at the age of 1-6 years from 10 day-care centers in Moscow, Smolensk and Yartstevo were examined and 410 strains of S.pneumoniae and 321 strains of <i>H.influenzae</i> were isolated. The resistance to beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole was determined with Etests method. The obtained data were published in Pediatric Infectious Diseases Journal (Pediatr Infect Dis J, 2000; 19:196-20), in International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (Int J Antimicrob Agents 2001; 18: 347-351) and were also presented on 9th ESCMID, Berlin, 21-25 March, 1999 <a href="en/ar/pub/p0581.shtml">[Poster&nbsp;P0581]</a>.</p></li>

<p class="j">In phase II 53 laboratories in 28 Russian cities performed identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 5 control strains of gram-positive bacteria granted by CDC (CDC-103 - CDC-107) to a defined set of antimicrobials. The results of this phase were presented on International Congress on Chemotherapy in Amsterdam, 2001 <a href="en/ar/pub/eqa.shtml">[Poster]</a>.</p>
