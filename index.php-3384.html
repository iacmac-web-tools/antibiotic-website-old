<h5>Goals of microbiological diagnostics in surgery</h5>

<p class="aj">Rational antibiotic therapy of surgical infections needs to be supported by microbiological diagnostics. In general, microbiological diagnostics pursues the following three goals:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>to provide information that is necessary both clinically and therapeutically</li>
  <li>to supply epidemiological information</li>
</ul>

<a name="3_2"></a><br>
<h5>When and how microbiological testing of intra-operative samples should be performed?</h5>

<p class="aj">The usefulness of intra-operative cultures to guide therapy of patients with community-acquired surgical infections is highly questionable. In contrast, culture and susceptibility testing of intra-operative isolates obtained from the patients with nosocomial surgical infections is highly desirable.</p>
<p class="aj">Accurate microbiological diagnosis is warranted only if samples isolated directly from the site of infection during the initial operation. In patients with established surgical infection all available type of samples should be obtained during the procedure. Culture of drainage and their discharges does not provide adequate diagnostic information.</p>

<a name="3_3"></a><br>
<h5>Optimizing use of diagnostic laboratory and accurate diagnosis</h5>

<p class="aj">Accurate diagnosis (or exclusion) of bacterial infections usually requires diagnostic tests to be conducted within the diagnostic laboratory. The importance of obtaining relevant, high-quality specimens for analysis cannot be underestimated. If a diagnostic laboratory is being used, the surgeon should also provide comprehensive and relevant clinical information about the patient and the specimens to the microbiologist, to enable them to process the specimens effectively and to interpret culture results accurately.</p>
<p>The request forms accompanying specimens are completed in full as they contain essential patient details and relevant clinical information:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>Physician's name/practice/health centre to which the completed report is to be returned</li>
  <li>Age of the patient</li>
  <li>Clinical presentation for suspecting infection. Descriptions such as &laquo;wound swab&raquo; or &laquo;leg ulcer&raquo; convey inadequate information, give no indication that the site is infected and may lead to the administration of antibiotics to patients who will not benefit from them</li>
  <li>Type of specimen obtained (e.g., midstream urine)</li>
  <li>Always state any antibiotic therapy that the patient is receiving currently or has received within the previous 7 days.</li>
</ul>

<a name="3_4"></a><br>
<h5>When in postoperative period culture is indicated?</h5>

<p class="aj">Clear evidence of wound infection (fever, discharge of pus from the incision) in postoperative patients is absolute indication for culture to be performed.</p>
<p class="aj">Additional microbiological testing should be done only if patient with established surgical site infection fails to treat and symptoms and signs of infection are not resolving. This serves as a guide for changing of antimicrobial, which should be performed after samples are taken and results of susceptibility testing are known.</p>

<a name="3_5"></a><br>
<h5>Do we need routinely culture for anaerobes?</h5>

<p class="aj">Routine culture for anaerobes is unnecessary. Rationale for this approach is expensiveness of this method, that requires specific facilities and materials. Surgeon should suspect of anaerobes as a causative agents based on localization of infection and probable source of infection. These data as well as clinical picture allow prompt the diagnosis of infection caused by anaerobes and administer therapeutic or prophylactic antmicrobials with anti-anaerobic activity.</p>
