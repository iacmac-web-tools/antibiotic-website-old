The IACMAC organizing group from Smolensk provided great leadership, and special thanks are owed to Leonid Stratchounski, IACMAC's President, and his colleague, Roman Kozlov, who is also an ASM Ambassador. ASM believes that the advantages of scientific cooperation and collegiality resulting from collaborative efforts like this one, cannot be overstated. ASM is looking forward to a continuing collaboration with the IACMAC.</p></ul>

  <td width="95%"><ul><p>Thank you so very much for a wonderful and enlightening time in Moscow. I thought the meetings were excellent, well coordinated, and very useful to myself. I hope my contribution was useful in return. I thank all of your colleagues who worked so hard to allow a flawless meeting venue. I also thank all those who took care of us and who put so much time into making sure our visit was successful. I can assure you the visit was a success and I heard from many of my colleagues from the U.S. that they were very pleasantly surprised and had a wonderful time. I am looking forward to a continued association with your group and hope that I may be able to participate in next years program in St.Petersburg. Again, thank you very much for the opportunity to visit with you and for the chance for making so many new friends.</p></ul>

in Eastern Europe such a smashing success. All of our speakers were as delighted 
as I to be able to participate in an enterprise of such high quality. Your
