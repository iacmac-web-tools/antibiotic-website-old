<h3 class="c">II. Antimicrobial Resistance</h3>

<p class="aj">The development of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is becoming an increasingly important public health problem that threatens to undermine the ability of healthcare professionals to effectively treat patients with bacterial infections.</p>
<p class="aj">There is no doubt that despite of the existence of more than 150 antimicrobial agents, a person nowadays can die as a result of a multi-resistant bacterial infection.</p>
<p class="aj">Antimicrobial resistance is widely acknowledged to be partly a consequence of the inappropriate administration and use of antimicrobials. Factors that contribute to the development of bacterial resistance include: low doses of antimicrobial agents; antimicrobial administration that is continued over a long period of time; antimicrobials being taken for infections that are viral and/or self-limiting and do not need treatment; or when advanced, broad-spectrum antimicrobials are used when more narrowly focused antimicrobials would work equally well.</p>
<p class="aj">At least for the hospital setting, six lines of evidence have linked antimicrobial misuse and overuse with antimicrobial resistance in hospital bacteria:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>Antimicrobial resistance is more prevalent in bacterial strains causing nosocomial infection than in organisms from community-acquired cases;</li>
  <li>During outbreaks, patients with resistant strains are more likely to have received prior antibiotic therapy than control patients;</li>
  <li>Changes in antimicrobial usage lead to parallel changes in prevalence of resistance;</li>
  <li>Areas within the hospital having the highest usage of antimicrobials also have the highest prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria;</li>
  <li>An increasing likelihood of colonization or infection with resistant organisms occurs with increasing duration of exposure to antimicrobials in the hospital;</li>
  <li>Inadequate dosage of antimicrobials leads to greater likelihood of superinfection or colonization with resistant organisms.</li>
</ul>

<h5>What actions should every surgeon take concerning antimicrobial resistance?</h5>

<p class="aj">A few studies have suggested that resistant clones can be replaced by susceptible ones; in general, however, resistance is slow reverse or is irreversible. Therefore antimicrobial resistance could not be prevented but it could be contained.</p>
<p class="aj">What actions surgeons can take to contain development of antimicrobial resistance:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>Adhere to hand hygiene.</li>
  <li>Make an accurate diagnosis by using cultures.</li>
  <li>Prescribe antibiotics, taking into account local data on antibiotic resistance.</li>
  <li>Administer only antimicrobials, which included in antibiotic part of hospital drug formulary.</li>
  <li>Adhere to basic principles of antimicrobial prophylaxis and antimicrobial therapy in surgery.</li>
  <li>Do not use broad-spectrum antibiotics when available narrower-spectrum antibiotics are at least as effective.</li>
  <li>Revise treatment regimens based on microbiological test result, and patient progress when treating empirically.</li>
  <li>Use shorter courses of treatment when they have been proven effective.</li>
  <li>Isolate hospital patients infected with or colonized by resistant organisms.</li>
  <li>Communicate with clinical microbiologists, infection control group (or clinical epidemiologist) and members of antibiotic drug committee.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Resistance monitoring</h5>

<p class="aj">Knowledge of resistance permits more appropriate use of antibiotics where it is necessary to give &laquo;blind&raquo; treatment (for example, in life-threatening infections where antibiotics must be prescribed before the results of culture and sensitivity tests are known).</p>
<p class="aj">The basis for resistance monitoring is microbiological diagnostics. Microbiological routine data and special surveys (e.g. prevalence studies) provide the basic data for resistance monitoring.</p>
<p class="aj">Resistance monitoring can be undertaken on a bacteria-related basis (e.g. MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producers) for the entire hospital or for special wards, such as the intensive care units or surgical unit. It can also be ward-related, depending on the size of the relevant hospital and the existence of special wards.</p>
<p>Resistance monitoring must yield the following important results:</p>
<ul class="txt">
  <li>Reports on the resistance situation conducted at regular intervals in a microbiological laboratory.</li>
  <li>Early detection of small-scale epidemics and resistance developments.</li>
