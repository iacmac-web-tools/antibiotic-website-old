<H1>Increases in Fluoroquinolone-Resistant <I>Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae</I> Among Men Who Have Sex with Men --- United States, 2003, and 
Revised Recommendations for Gonorrhea Treatment, 2004</FONT></H1>
<P>In the United States, an estimated 700,000--800,000 persons are infected with 
<I>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</I> each year (<I>1,2</I>). 
Since 1993, CDC has recommended use of fluoroquinolones (i.e., ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or levofloxacin) for gonorrhea 
treatment. Fluoroquinolone therapy is used frequently because it is an inexpensive, oral, and single-dose therapy. However, 
because of increased prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant 
<I>N. gonorrhoeae</I> (QRNG)* in Asia, the Pacific Islands (including Hawaii), 
and California, fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for treating gonorrhea acquired in those locations 
(<I><a href="mm4937a1.htm">3</a>--<a href="mm5146a1.htm">5</a></I>). This report describes increases in QRNG among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Massachusetts, New York City, and 30 
sites surveyed by the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) during 2003. CDC recommends that clinicians no longer 
use fluoroquinolones as a first-line treatment for gonorrhea in MSM.
<H4>
<B>GISP</B>
</H4>
<P>GISP is a CDC-sponsored sentinel surveillance system that monitors antimicrobial susceptibilities in 
<I>N. gonorrhoeae</I> through ongoing testing of approximately 5,000 male urethral gonococcal isolates obtained annually from patients at 30 
sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the United States. Preliminary data collected during January--September 2003 from 
all GISP sites indicate a QRNG prevalence of 4.2%, 
compared with 2.2% in 2002 (<I>6</I>) and 0.7% in 2001 
(<I>6</I>). Excluding Hawaii and California, preliminary 2003 QRNG prevalence was 0.9% in 2003, compared with 0.4% in 2002 and 0.02% in 2001; 
in addition, in 2003, QRNG prevalence was 4.9% among MSM and 0.4% among heterosexual men (<a href = "#fig">Figure</a>), compared 
with 1.8% among MSM and 0.2% among heterosexual men in 2002. 
<H4>
<B>Massachusetts</B>
</H4>
<P>During January--August 2003, the Massachusetts State Laboratory Institute performed antimicrobial susceptibility tests on 
249 gonococcal isolates from 235 patients in clinical 
facilities throughout the state. QRNG accounted for 10.4% (26 of 249) of 
gonococcal isolates tested during this period, compared with 2.1% (10 of 486) in 2002 and zero (0 of 386) in 2001. 
<P>The 26 QRNG isolates in 2003 were obtained from 24 patients, of whom 22 were male and two were female partners 
of men identified with QRNG; seven (29%) were STD clinic patients. Of the 22 male QRNG patients, four (18%) 
reported having sex exclusively with women, one reported having sex with men and women, and 17 (77%) reported having 
sex exclusively with men. None of the patients with QRNG was identified as a result of treatment failure. 
<P>Medical records were reviewed for all 111 male gonorrhea patients who had diagnosis by culture at STD clinics in the 
state. Of these, seven (6.3%) had QRNG identified, with 11.1% (six of 54) QRNG prevalence among MSM and 1.8% (one of 
55) among heterosexual men. A total of 14 female patients had gonorrhea diagnosed at STD clinics; none had QRNG.
<P>Since 1987, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has recommended use of ceftriaxone rather 
than fluoroquinolones for treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections. When local increases in QRNG were identified 
in late 2002, the health department issued a clinical advisory to health-care providers throughout the state, alerting them to 
the increase and advising that fluoroquinolones were not recommended for gonorrhea treatment unless 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing excluded fluoroquinolone 
resistance<SUP>&#134;</SUP>. Beginning in June 2003, any health-care provider who 
reported a patient who had been treated with a fluoroquinolone was sent a notice recommending that a test of cure be performed 
unless susceptibility testing was performed initially to rule out QRNG. 
<H4>
<B>New York City</B>
</H4>
<P>During January--July 2003, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 643 gonococcal isolates from 
patients evaluated at the 10 STD clinics operated by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau 
of Sexually Transmitted Disease Control. During this interval, antimicrobial resistance information was available from 
cultures performed on oropharyngeal and rectal specimens in all 10 clinics. Consequently, MSM probably are overrepresented 
among men who have culture-confirmed gonorrhea. In one clinic, cultures also were performed on urethral specimens. None of 
the 
</P><BR>
clinics obtained endocervical specimens for culture. Most testing for gonorrhea was conducted by using nucleic 
acid amplification methods. QRNG accounted for 3.4% (22 of 643) of isolates tested during January--July 2003, compared 
with 0.3% (eight of 3,196) in 2002 and 0.1% (three of 3,144) in 2001. 
<P>Medical record reviews were performed at six of the STD clinics. During January--July 2003, a total of 394 
gonococcal isolates from 369 patients at these six clinics were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility; QRNG was identified in 5% (18 
of 369) of the patients. Seventeen (94%) of the 18 patients with QRNG were male, and 13 (77%) reported being MSM. 
QRNG prevalence among patients for whom sexual behavior was documented was 12.5% (14 of 112) among MSM, 1.6% (three 
of 183) among heterosexual men, and 2.4% (one of 42) among women. 
<P>Fourteen of the 17 patients with QRNG for whom gonorrhea treatment history was available had been treated 
with ceftriaxone. New York City STD clinic treatment protocols specify that gonorrhea be treated with ceftriaxone and 
that fluoroquinolones only be used if culture is performed so the patient can be recalled if QRNG is identified.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
<P> Fluoroquinolones are  used frequently to treat gonorrhea in the United States because they are 
inexpensive and easy to administer and their continued use might decrease the use of cephalosporins and delay the development 
of cephalosporin resistance. However, local and national data suggest that the prevalence of QRNG among MSM infected 
with gonorrhea is close to or exceeds 5%. This level of resistance often is used as the level at which a therapeutic regimen should 
be changed (<I>7</I>); other factors, including prevalence of gonorrhea, availability of antimicrobial susceptibility data, and cost 
of various diagnostic and treatment options, might result in higher or lower thresholds for change. In the absence 
of antimicrobial susceptibility testing or tests of cure, fluoroquinolones should no longer be used to treat proven or 
suspected gonococcal infections in MSM in the United States. Health departments should notify clinicians about this 
new recommendation. Some local health departments have issued similar recommendations recently.
<P>Fluoroquinolones also should not be used to treat patients whose gonorrhea was acquired in Asia, the Pacific 
Islands (including Hawaii), California, and other areas, such as 
England and Wales, with increased QRNG prevalence 
(<I><a href="rr5106a1.htm">4</a>,8</I>). For those infections acquired where QRNG is not endemic, before 
determining treatment, clinicians should obtain travel histories 
from patients and information on the sex of sex partners from male patients with proven or suspected gonorrhea. A list of 
places that should be included in a relevant travel history is available at 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/gisp">http://www.cdc.gov/std/gisp</a>.
<P>For patients with gonorrhea who are MSM or who provide a history suggesting acquisition of infection in an area with 
high QRNG prevalence, CDC recommends ceftriaxone 125 mg intramuscularly or cefixime 400 mg orally (not currently 
available in the United States [<I><a href="mm5146a6.htm">9</a></I>]); spectinomycin 2 g 
intramuscularly is an alternative. Spectinomycin may be used for urogenital 
and anorectal gonorrhea but is not sufficiently effective to treat 
pharyngeal gonorrhea (<I><a href="rr5106a1.htm">4</a>,10</I>). If <I>Chlamydia 
trachomatis</I> is not ruled out, each regimen should be followed with either azithromycin 1.0 g orally (single dose) or doxycycline 100 mg orally 
twice daily for 7 days to treat possible co-infection with chlamydia. 
<P>The limited availability of a recommended oral treatment regimen for gonorrhea poses practical problems for 
treating QRNG. Besides the fluoroquinolones, cefixime, whose 
manufacture was discontinued in 2002, is the only 
CDC-recommended oral agent for treating gonorrhea. Although Lupin, Ltd. (Baltimore, Maryland) received Food and 
Drug Administration approval to manufacture and market cefixime in February 2004, the 400-mg tablets to treat gonorrhea are 
not yet available; the suspension (100 mg/5 mL) is available. The health 
departments of California and Washington state 
have suggested alternative oral treatments (e.g., cefpodoxime 400 mg) that have not yet been evaluated adequately. CDC 
will provide additional information about the availability of cefixime and efficacy of other oral agents for treating 
gonorrhea as it becomes available (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/cefixime.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/cefixime.htm</a>).
<P>Clinicians must be vigilant in identifying treatment failures when fluoroquinolones are used, advise their patients about 
the importance of follow-up if symptoms persist, and be 
prepared to evaluate such cases by culture. In cases of 
persistent gonococcal infection after treatment with fluoroquinolones, antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed. 
Only culture of <I>N. gonorrhoeae</I> can be used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. Health departments without the capacity 
to perform culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should develop those capabilities locally or partner with 
laboratories outside their jurisdictions. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing panel should, at a minimum, include a 
fluoroquinolone, ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, azithromycin, and any other drugs in local use for gonorrhea treatment. Arrangements 
for
antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be made by contacting state and local health departments. Through their state 
and local health departments, clinicians and laboratorians should report treatment failures or resistant gonococcal isolates to 
CDC, telephone 404-639-2059. 
</P> 
<P>Given the apparent low prevalence of QRNG among heterosexuals, a national change in treatment in that group is 
not recommended at this time. However, QRNG prevalence among heterosexuals is likely to increase over time and 
already might be high enough in some areas to warrant new local treatment recommendations. For example, increased prevalence of 
QRNG among heterosexuals has been identified in several counties in Michigan, where recommendations have been made to 
avoid using fluoroquinolones among all persons infected with gonorrhea. Because gonococcal infections, especially in 
women, frequently are asymptomatic, monitoring for symptomatic treatment failures alone does not provide a reliable indication 
of emerging antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, as part of effective gonorrhea-control programs, health departments 
should evaluate their current QRNG surveillance activities and consider plans to monitor for the presence of QRNG 
among heterosexual populations with gonorrhea. If prevalence increases nationally among heterosexuals, guidance from CDC will 
be forthcoming. Local and state treatment recommendations, technical information, surveillance data, references, and other 
links related to gonococcal resistance are available at
