<p>1998 Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases </p>
<p>Summary </p>
<p>These guidelines for the treatment of patients who have
 sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by CDC staff members
 after
consultation with a group of invited experts who met in Atlanta on
 February
10-12, 1997. The information in this report updates the &quot;1993
 Sexually
Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines&quot; (MMWR 1993;42{no.
 RR-14}).
Included are new recommendations for treatment of primary and
 recurrent
genital herpes and management of pelvic inflammatory disease; a new

patient-applied medication for treatment of genital warts; and a
 revised
approach to the management of victims of sexual assault. Revised
 sections
describe the evaluation of urethritis and the diagnostic evaluation
 of
congenital syphilis. These guidelines also include expanded
 sections
concerning STDs among infants, children, and pregnant women and the

management of patients who have asymptomatic human immunodeficiency
 virus
infection, genital warts, and genital herpes. Guidelines are
 provided for
vaccine-preventable STDs, including recommendations for the use of
hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines. </p>
<br>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>Physicians and other health-care providers have a critical role
 in
preventing and treating sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). These

recommendations for the treatment of STDs, which were developed by
 CDC
staff members in consultation with a group of invited experts, are
 intended
to assist with that effort. </p>
<p>This report was produced through a multi-stage process.
 Beginning in
the spring of 1996, CDC personnel and invited experts
 systematically
reviewed literature concerning each of the major STDs, focusing on
information that had become available since the &quot;1993 Sexually
 Transmitted
Diseases Treatment Guidelines&quot; (MMWR 1993;42{no. RR-14}) were
 published.
Background papers were written and tables of evidence constructed
summarizing the type of study (e.g., randomized controlled trial or
 case
series), study population and setting, treatments or other
 interventions,
outcome measures assessed, reported findings, and weaknesses and
 biases in
study design and analysis. For these reviews, published abstracts
 and
peer-reviewed journal articles were considered. A draft document
 was
developed on the basis of the reviews. </p>
<p>In February 1997, invited consultants assembled in Atlanta for
 a 3-day
meeting. CDC personnel and invited experts presented the key
 questions on
STD treatment suggested from the literature reviews and presented
 the
information available to answer those questions. Where relevant,
 the
questions focused on four principal outcomes of STD therapy: a)
microbiologic cure, b) alleviation of signs and symptoms, c)
 prevention of
sequelae, and d) prevention of transmission. Cost-effectiveness and
 other
advantages (e.g., single-dose formulations and directly observed
 therapy)
of specific regimens also were considered. The consultants then
 assessed
whether the questions identified were appropriate, ranked them in
 order of
priority, and attempted to arrive at answers using the available
 evidence.
In addition, the consultants evaluated the quality of evidence
 supporting
the answers on the basis of the number, type, and quality of the
 studies. </p>
<p>In several areas, the process diverged from that described
 previously.
The sections concerning adolescents, congenital syphilis, and
 partner
notification were reviewed by other CDC experts on prevention of
 STDs and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The recommendations
 for STD
screening during pregnancy were developed after CDC staff reviewed
 the
published recommendations of other expert groups. The sections
 concerning
early HIV infection are a compilation of recommendations developed
 by CDC
experts in HIV infection. The sections on hepatitis B virus (HBV)
 (1) and
hepatitis A virus (HAV) (2) infections are based on previously
 published
recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
 (ACIP). </p>
<p>Throughout this report, the evidence used as the basis for
 specific
recommendations is discussed briefly. More comprehensive, annotated

discussions of such evidence will appear in background papers that
 will be
published in 1998. When more than one therapeutic regimen is
 recommended,
the sequence is alphabetized unless there is priority of choice
 (i.e.,
based on efficacy, convenience, and cost). Almost all recommended
 regimens
have similar efficacy and similar rates of intolerance or toxicity
 unless
otherwise specified. </p>
<p>These recommendations were developed in consultation with
 experts whose
experience is primarily with the treatment of patients in public
 STD
clinics. Nevertheless, these recommendations also should be
 applicable to
other patient-care settings, including family planning clinics,
 private
physicians' offices, managed care organizations, and other
 primary-care
facilities. When using these guidelines, the disease prevalence and
 other
characteristics of the medical practice setting should be
 considered. These
recommendations should be regarded as a source of clinical guidance
 and not
as standards or inflexible rules. </p>
<p>These recommendations focus on the treatment and counseling of
individual patients and do not address other community services and

interventions that are important in STD/HIV prevention. Clinical
 and
laboratory diagnoses are described when such information is related
 to
therapy. For a more comprehensive discussion of diagnosis, refer to
 CDC's
Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinical Practice Guidelines, 1991
 (3). </p>
<br>
<p>CLINICAL PREVENTION GUIDELINES </p>
<p>The prevention and control of STDs is based on five major
 concepts:
first, education of those at risk on ways to reduce the risk for
 STDs;
second, detection of asymptomatically infected persons and of
 symptomatic
persons unlikely to seek diagnostic and treatment services; third,
effective diagnosis and treatment of infected persons; fourth,
 evaluation,
treatment, and counseling of sex partners of persons who are
 infected with
an STD; and fifth, preexposure vaccination of persons at risk for
vaccine-preventable STDs. Although this report focuses primarily on
 the
clinical aspects of STD control, prevention of STDs is based on
 changing
the sexual behaviors that place persons at risk for infection.
 Moreover,
because STD control activities reduce the likelihood of
 transmission to sex
partners, prevention for individuals constitutes prevention for the

community. </p>
<p>Clinicians have the opportunity to provide client education and

counseling and to participate in identifying and treating infected
 sex
partners in addition to interrupting transmission by treating
 persons who
have the curable bacterial and parasitic STDs. The ability of the
health-care provider to obtain an accurate sexual history is
 crucial in
prevention and control efforts. Guidance in obtaining a sexual
 history is
available in the chapter &quot;Sexuality and Reproductive Health&quot; in
Contraceptive Technology, 16th edition (4). The accurate diagnosis
 and
timely reporting of STDs by the clinician is the basis for
 effective public
health surveillance. </p>
<p>Prevention Messages </p>
<p>Preventing the spread of STDs requires that persons at risk for

transmitting or acquiring infections change their behaviors. The
 essential
first step is for the health-care provider to proactively include
 questions
regarding the patient's sexual history as part of the clinical
 interview.
When risk factors have been identified, the provider has an
 opportunity to
deliver prevention messages. Counseling skills (i.e., respect,
 compassion,
and a nonjudgmental attitude) are essential to the effective
 delivery of
prevention messages. Techniques that can be effective in
 facilitating a
rapport with the patient include using open-ended questions, using
understandable language, and reassuring the patient that treatment
 will be
provided regardless of considerations such as ability to pay,
 citizenship
or immigration status, language spoken, or lifestyle. </p>
<p>Prevention messages should be tailored to the patient, with
consideration given to the patient's specific risk factors for
 STDs.
Messages should include a description of specific actions that the
 patient
can take to avoid acquiring or transmitting STDs (e.g., abstinence
 from
sexual activity if STD-related symptoms develop). </p>
<p>Sexual Transmission </p>
<p>The most effective way to prevent sexual transmission of HIV
 infection
and other STDs is to avoid sexual intercourse with an infected
 partner.
Counseling that provides information concerning abstinence from
 penetrative
sexual intercourse is crucial for a) persons who are being treated
 for an
STD or whose partners are undergoing treatment and b) persons who
 wish to
avoid the possible consequences of sexual intercourse (e.g.,
 STD/HIV and
pregnancy). A more comprehensive discussion of abstinence is
 available in
Contraceptive Technology, 16th edition (4). </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Both partners should get tested for STDs, including HIV, before

    initiating sexual intercourse. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    If a person chooses to have sexual intercourse with a partner
 whose
    infection status is unknown or who is infected with HIV or
 another STD,
    a new condom should be used for each act of intercourse. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Injecting-Drug Users </p>
<p>The following prevention messages are appropriate for
 injecting-drug
users: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Enroll or continue in a drug-treatment program. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Do not, under any circumstances, use injection equipment (e.g.,
 needles
    and syringes) that has been used by another person. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    If needles can be obtained legally in the community, obtain
 clean
    needles. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Persons who continue to use injection equipment that has been
 used by
    other persons should first clean the equipment with bleach and
 water.
    (Disinfecting with bleach does not sterilize the equipment and
 does not
    guarantee that HIV is inactivated. However, for injecting-drug
 users,
    thoroughly and consistently cleaning injection equipment with
 bleach
    should reduce the rate of HIV transmission when equipment is
 shared.) </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Preexposure Vaccination </p>
<p>Preexposure vaccination is one of the most effective methods
 used to
prevent transmission of certain STDs. HBV infection frequently is
 sexually
transmitted, and hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all
unvaccinated patients being evaluated for an STD. In the United
 States,
hepatitis A vaccines from two manufacturers were licensed recently.

Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for several groups of
 patients who
might seek treatment in STD clinics; such patients include
 homosexual or
bisexual men and persons who use illegal drugs. Vaccine trials for
 other
STDs are being conducted, and vaccines for these STDs may become
 available
within the next several years. </p>
<p>Prevention Methods </p>
<p>Male Condoms </p>
<p>When used consistently and correctly, condoms are effective in
preventing many STDs, including HIV infection. Multiple cohort
 studies,
including those of serodiscordant sex partners, have demonstrated a
 strong
protective effect of condom use against HIV infection. Because
 condoms do
not cover all exposed areas, they may be more effective in
 preventing
infections transmitted between mucosal surfaces than those
 transmitted by
skin-to-skin contact. Condoms are regulated as medical devices and
 are
subject to random sampling and testing by the Food and Drug
 Administration
(FDA). Each latex condom manufactured in the United States is
 tested
electronically for holes before packaging. Rates of condom breakage
 during
sexual intercourse and withdrawal are low in the United States
 (i.e.,
usually two broken condoms per 100 condoms used). Condom failure
 usually
results from inconsistent or incorrect use rather than condom
 breakage. </p>
<p>Patients should be advised that condoms must be used
 consistently and
correctly to be highly effective in preventing STDs. Patients also
 should
be instructed in the correct use of condoms. The following
 recommendations
ensure the proper use of male condoms: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Use a new condom with each act of sexual intercourse. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Carefully handle the condom to avoid damaging it with
 fingernails,
    teeth, or other sharp objects. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Put the condom on after the penis is erect and before genital
 contact
    with the partner. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Ensure that no air is trapped in the tip of the condom. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Ensure that adequate lubrication exists during intercourse,
 possibly
    requiring the use of exogenous lubricants. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Use only water-based lubricants (e.g., K-Y Jelly (TM),
 Astroglide (TM),
    AquaLube (TM), and glycerin) with latex condoms. Oil-based
 lubricants
    (e.g., petroleum jelly, shortening, mineral oil, massage oils,
 body
    lotions, and cooking oil) can weaken latex. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Hold the condom firmly against the base of the penis during
 withdrawal,
    and withdraw while the penis is still erect to prevent
 slippage. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Female Condoms </p>
<p>Laboratory studies indicate that the female condom (Reality
 (TM)) -- a
lubricated polyurethane sheath with a ring on each end that is
 inserted
into the vagina -- is an effective mechanical barrier to viruses,
 including
HIV. Other than one investigation of recurrent trichomoniasis, no
 clinical
studies have been completed to evaluate the efficacy of female
 condoms in
providing protection from STDs, including HIV. If used consistently
 and
correctly, the female condom should substantially reduce the risk
 for STDs.
When a male condom cannot be used appropriately, sex partners
 should
consider using a female condom. </p>
<p>Condoms and Spermicides </p>
<p>Whether condoms lubricated with spermicides are more effective
 than
other lubricated condoms in protecting against the transmission of
 HIV and
other STDs has not been determined. Furthermore, spermicide-coated
 condoms
have been associated with Escherichia coli urinary tract infection
 in young
women. Whether condoms used with vaginal application of spermicide
 are more
effective than condoms used without vaginal spermicides also has
 not been
determined. Therefore, the consistent use of condoms, with or
 without
spermicidal lubricant or vaginal application of spermicide, is
 recommended. </p>
<p>Vaginal Spermicides, Sponges, and Diaphragms </p>
<p>As demonstrated in several randomized controlled trials,
 vaginal
spermicides used alone without condoms reduce the risk for cervical

gonorrhea and chlamydia. However, vaginal spermicides offer no
 protection
against HIV infection, and spermicides are not recommended for HIV
prevention. The vaginal contraceptive sponge, which is not
 available in the
United States, protects against cervical gonorrhea and chlamydia,
 but its
use increases the risk for candidiasis. In case-control and
 cross-sectional
studies, diaphragm use has been demonstrated to protect against
 cervical
gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis; however, no cohort
 studies have
been conducted. Vaginal sponges or diaphragms should not be assumed
 to
protect women against HIV infection. The role of spermicides,
 sponges, and
diaphragms for preventing STDs in men has not been evaluated. </p>
<p>Nonbarrier Contraception, Surgical Sterilization, and Hysterectomy </p>
<p>Women who are not at risk for pregnancy might incorrectly
 perceive
themselves to be at no risk for STDs, including HIV infection.
 Nonbarrier
contraceptive methods offer no protection against HIV or other
 STDs.
Hormonal contraception (e.g., oral contraceptives, Norplant (TM),
 and
Depo-Provera (TM)) has been associated in some cohort studies with
 cervical
STDs and increased acquisition of HIV; however, data concerning
 this latter
finding are inconsistent. Women who use hormonal contraception,
 have been
surgically sterilized, or have had hysterectomies should be
 counseled
regarding the use of condoms and the risk for STDs, including HIV
infection. </p>
<p>HIV Prevention Counseling </p>
<p>Knowledge of HIV status and appropriate counseling are
 important
components in initiating behavior change. Therefore, HIV counseling
 is an
important HIV prevention strategy, although its efficacy in
 reducing risk
behaviors is still being evaluated. By ensuring that counseling is
 empathic
and client-centered, clinicians can develop a realistic appraisal
 of the
patient's risk and help the patient develop a specific and
 realistic HIV
prevention plan (5). </p>
<p>Counseling associated with HIV testing has two main components:
 pretest
and posttest counseling. During pretest counseling, the clinician
 should
conduct a personalized risk assessment, explain the meaning of
 positive and
negative test results, ask for informed consent for the HIV test,
 and help
the patient develop a realistic, personalized risk-reduction plan.
 During
posttest counseling, the clinician should inform the patient of the

results, review the meaning of the results, and reinforce
 prevention
messages. If the patient has a confirmed positive HIV test result,
 posttest
counseling should include referral for follow-up medical services
 and, if
needed, social and psychological services. HIV-negative patients at

continuing risk for HIV infection also may benefit from referral
 for
additional counseling and prevention services. </p>
<p>Partner Notification </p>
<p>For most STDs, partners of patients should be examined. When
 exposure
to a treatable STD is considered likely, appropriate antimicrobials
 should
be administered even though no clinical signs of infection are
 evident and
laboratory test results are not yet available. In many states, the
 local or
state health department can assist in notifying the partners of
 patients
who have selected STDs (e.g., HIV infection, syphilis, gonorrhea,
 hepatitis
B, and chlamydia). </p>
<p>Health-care providers should advise patients who have an STD to
 notify
sex partners, including those without symptoms, of their exposure
 and
encourage these partners to seek clinical evaluation. This type of
 partner
notification is known as patient referral. In situations in which
 patient
referral may not be effective or possible, health departments
 should be
prepared to assist the patient either through contract referral or
 provider
referral. Contract referral is the process by which patients agree
 to
self-refer their partners within a defined time period. If the
 partners do
not obtain medical evaluation and treatment within that period,
 then
provider referral is implemented. Provider referral is the process
 by which
partners named by infected patients are notified and counseled by
 health
department staff. </p>
<p>Interrupting the transmission of infection is crucial to STD
 control.
For treatable and vaccine-preventable STDs, further transmission
 and
reinfection can be prevented by referral of sex partners for
 diagnosis,
treatment, vaccination (if applicable), and counseling. When
 health-care
providers refer infected patients to local or state health
 departments for
provider-referral partner notification, the patients may be
 interviewed by
trained professionals to obtain the names of their sex partners and

information regarding the location of these partners for
 notification
purposes. Every health department protects the privacy of patients
 in
partner-notification activities. Because of the advantage of
confidentiality, many patients prefer that public health officials
 notify
partners. However, the ability of public health officials to
 provide
appropriate prophylaxis to contacts of all patients who have STDs
 may be
limited. In situations where the number of anonymous partners is
substantial (e.g., situations among persons who exchange sex for
 drugs),
targeted screening of persons at risk may be more effective at
 stopping the
transmission of disease than provider-referral partner
 notification.
Guidelines for management of sex partners and recommendations for
 partner
notification for specific STDs are included for each STD addressed
 in this
report. </p>
<p>Reporting and Confidentiality </p>
<p>The accurate identification and timely reporting of STDs are
 integral
components of successful disease control efforts. Timely reporting
 is
important for assessing morbidity trends, targeting limited
 resources, and
assisting local health authorities in identifying sex partners who
 may be
infected. STD/HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
 cases
should be reported in accordance with local statutory requirements.
 </p>
<p>Syphilis, gonorrhea, and AIDS are reportable diseases in every
 state.
Chlamydial infection is reportable in most states. The requirements
 for
reporting other STDs differ by state, and clinicians should be
 familiar
with local STD reporting requirements. Reporting may be provider-
 and/or
laboratory-based. Clinicians who are unsure of local reporting
 requirements
should seek advice from local health departments or state STD
 programs. </p>
<p>STD and HIV reports are maintained in strictest confidence; in
 most
jurisdictions, such reports are protected by statute from subpoena.
 Before
public health representatives conduct follow-up of a positive
 STD-test
result, these persons should consult the patient's health-care
 provider to
verify the diagnosis and treatment. </p>
<br>
<p>SPECIAL POPULATIONS </p>
<p>Pregnant Women </p>
<p>Intrauterine or perinatally transmitted STDs can have fatal or
 severely
debilitating effects on a fetus. Pregnant women and their sex
 partners
should be questioned about STDs and should be counseled about the
possibility of perinatal infections. </p>
<p>Recommended Screening Tests </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    A serologic test for syphilis should be performed on all
 pregnant women
    at the first prenatal visit. In populations in which
 utilization of
    prenatal care is not optimal, rapid plasma reagin (RPR)-card
 test
    screening and treatment, if that test is reactive, should be
 performed
    at the time a pregnancy is diagnosed. For patients at high
 risk,
    screening should be repeated in the third trimester and again
 at
    delivery. Some states also mandate screening all women at
 delivery. No
    infant should be discharged from the hospital without the
 syphilis
    serologic status of its mother having been determined at least
 one time
    during pregnancy and, preferably, again at delivery. Any woman
 who
    delivers a stillborn infant should be tested for syphilis. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A serologic test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) should
 be
    performed for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit.
 HBsAg
    testing should be repeated late in the pregnancy for women who
 are
    HBsAg negative but who are at high risk for HBV infection
 (e.g.,
    injecting-drug users and women who have concomitant STDs). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae should be performed at the
 first
    prenatal visit for women at risk or for women living in an area
 in
    which the prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae is high. A repeat test
 should be
    performed during the third trimester for those at continued
 risk. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A test for Chlamydia trachomatis should be performed in the
 third
    trimester for women at increased risk (i.e., women aged less
 than 25
    years and women who have a new or more than one sex partner or
 whose
    partner has other partners) to prevent maternal postnatal
 complications
    and chlamydial infection in the infant. Screening during the
 first
    trimester might enable prevention of adverse effects of
 chlamydia
    during pregnancy. However, evidence for adverse effects during
    pregnancy is minimal. If screening is performed only during the
 first
    trimester, a longer period exists for acquiring infection
 before
    delivery. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A test for HIV infection should be offered to all pregnant
 women at the
    first prenatal visit. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A test for bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be conducted early in
 the
    second trimester for asymptomatic patients who are at high risk
 for
    preterm labor (e.g., those who have a history of a previous
 preterm
    delivery). Current evidence does not support universal testing
 for BV. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A Papanicolaou (Pap) smear should be obtained at the first
 prenatal
    visit if none has been documented during the preceding year. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Other Concerns </p>
<p>Other STD-related concerns are to be considered as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Pregnant women who have either primary genital herpes
 infection, HBV,
    primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, or Group B
 streptococcal
    infection and women who have syphilis and who are allergic to
    penicillin may need to be referred to an expert for management.
 </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be reported to the local
 and/or
    state health department to ensure that they are entered into a
    case-management system and appropriate prophylaxis is provided
 for
    their infants. In addition, household and sexual contacts of
    HBsAg-positive women should be vaccinated. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    In the absence of lesions during the third trimester, routine
 serial
    cultures for herpes simplex virus (HSV) are not indicated for
 women who
    have a history of recurrent genital herpes. However, obtaining
 cultures
    from such women at the time of delivery may be useful in
 guiding
    neonatal management. Prophylactic cesarean section is not
 indicated for
    women who do not have active genital lesions at the time of
 delivery. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The presence of genital warts is not an indication for cesarean

    section. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For a more detailed discussion of these guidelines, as well as
 for
infections not transmitted sexually, refer to Guidelines for
 Perinatal Care
(6). </p>
<p>NOTE: The sources for these guidelines for screening of pregnant
 women
include the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services (7), Guidelines
 for
Perinatal Care (6), American College of Obstetricians and
 Gynecologists
(ACOG) Technical Bulletin: Gonorrhea and Chlamydial Infections (8),

&quot;Recommendations for the Prevention and Management of Chlamydia
 trachomatis
Infections&quot; (9), and &quot;Hepatitis B Virus: A Comprehensive Strategy
 for
Eliminating Transmission in the United States through Universal
 Childhood
Vaccination -- Recommendations of the Immunization Practices
 Advisory
Committee (ACIP)&quot; (1). These sources are not entirely compatible in
 their
recommendations. The Guide to Clinical Preventive Services
 recommends
screening of patients at high risk for chlamydia, but indicates
 that the
optimal timing for screening is uncertain. The Guidelines for
 Perinatal
Care recommend that pregnant women at high risk for chlamydia be
 screened
for the infection during the first prenatal-care visit and during
 the third
trimester. Recommendations to screen pregnant women for STDs are
 based on
disease severity and sequelae, prevalence in the population, costs,

medicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors.
 The
screening recommendations in this report are more extensive (i.e.,
 if
followed, more women will be screened for more STDs than would be
 screened
by following other recommendations) and are compatible with other
 CDC
guidelines. Physicians should select a screening strategy that is
compatible with the population and setting of their medical
 practices and
that meets their goals for STD case detection and treatment. </p>
<p>Adolescents </p>
<p>Health-care providers who provide care for adolescents should
 be aware
of several issues that relate specifically to these persons. The
 rates of
many STDs are highest among adolescents (e.g., the rate of
 gonorrhea is
highest among females aged 15-19 years). Clinic-based studies have
demonstrated that the prevalence of chlamydial infections, and
 possibly of
human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, also is highest among
 adolescents.
In addition, surveillance data indicate that 9% of adolescents who
 have
acute HBV infection either a) have had sexual contact with a
 chronically
infected person or with multiple sex partners or b) gave their
 sexual
preference as homosexual. As part of a comprehensive strategy to
 eliminate
HBV transmission in the United States, ACIP has recommended that
 all
children be administered hepatitis B vaccine. </p>
<p>Adolescents who are at high risk for STDs include male
 homosexuals,
sexually active heterosexuals, clients in STD clinics, and
 injecting-drug
users. Younger adolescents (i.e., persons aged less than 15 years)
 who are
sexually active are at particular risk for infection. Adolescents
 are at
greatest risk for STDs because they frequently have unprotected
intercourse, are biologically more susceptible to infection, and
 face
multiple obstacles to utilization of health care. </p>
<p>Several of these issues can be addressed by clinicians who
 provide
services to adolescents. Clinicians can address the general lack of

knowledge and awareness about the risks and consequences of STDs
 and offer
guidance, constituting true primary prevention, to help adolescents
 develop
healthy sexual behaviors and prevent the establishment of patterns
 of
behavior that can undermine sexual health. With limited exceptions,
 all
adolescents in the United States can consent to the confidential
 diagnosis
and treatment of STDs. Medical care for STDs can be provided to
 adolescents
without parental consent or knowledge. Furthermore, in many states
adolescents can consent to HIV counseling and testing. Consent laws
 for
vaccination of adolescents differ by state. Several states consider

provision of vaccine similar to treatment of STDs and provide
 vaccination
services without parental consent. Providers should appreciate how
important confidentiality is to adolescents and should strive to
 follow
policies that comply with state laws to ensure the confidentiality
 of
STD-related services provided to adolescents. </p>
<p>The style and content of counseling and health education should
 be
adapted for adolescents. Discussions should be appropriate for the
patient's developmental level and should identify risky behaviors,
 such as
sex and drug-use behaviors. Careful counseling and thorough
 discussions are
especially important for adolescents who may not acknowledge
 engaging in
high-risk behaviors. Care and counseling should be direct and
nonjudgmental. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Management of children who have STDs requires close cooperation
 between
the clinician, laboratorians, and child-protection authorities.
Investigations, when indicated, should be initiated promptly. Some
 diseases
(e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia), if acquired after the
 neonatal
period, are almost 100% indicative of sexual contact. For other
 diseases,
such as HPV infection and vaginitis, the association with sexual
 contact is
not as clear (see Sexual Assault and STDs). </p>
<br>
<p>HIV INFECTION: DETECTION, INITIAL MANAGEMENT, AND REFERRAL </p>
<p>Infection with HIV produces a spectrum of disease that
 progresses from
a clinically latent or asymptomatic state to AIDS as a late
 manifestation.
The pace of disease progression is variable. The time between
 infection
with HIV and the development of AIDS ranges from a few months to as
 long as
17 years (median: 10 years). Most adults and adolescents infected
 with HIV
remain symptom-free for long periods, but viral replication is
 active
during all stages of infection, increasing substantially as the
 immune
system deteriorates. AIDS eventually develops in almost all
 HIV-infected
persons; in one study of HIV-infected adults, AIDS developed in 87%
 (95%
confidence interval {CI}=83%-90%) within 17 years after infection.
Additional cases are expected to occur among those who have
 remained
AIDS-free for longer periods. </p>
<p>Greater awareness among both patients and health-care providers
 of the
risk factors associated with HIV transmission has led to increased
 testing
for HIV and earlier diagnosis of the infection, often before
 symptoms
develop. The early diagnosis of HIV infection is important for
 several
reasons. Treatments are available to slow the decline of immune
 system
function. HIV-infected persons who have altered immune function are
 at
increased risk for infections for which preventive measures are
 available
(e.g., Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia {PCP}, toxoplasmic
 encephalitis {TE},
disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex {MAC} disease,
 tuberculosis {TB},
and bacterial pneumonia). Because of its effect on the immune
 system, HIV
affects the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of many
 other
diseases and may affect the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy for
 some
STDs. Finally, the early diagnosis of HIV enables the health-care
 provider
to counsel such patients and to assist in preventing HIV
 transmission to
others. </p>
<p>Proper management of HIV infection involves a complex array of
behavioral, psychosocial, and medical services. Although some of
 these
services may be available in the STD treatment facility, other
 services,
particularly medical services, are usually unavailable in this
 setting.
Therefore, referral to a health-care provider or facility
 experienced in
caring for HIV-infected patients is advised. Staff in STD treatment

facilities should be knowledgeable about the options for referral
 available
in their communities. While in the STD treatment facility, the
 HIV-infected
patient should be educated about HIV infection and the various
 options for
HIV care that are available. </p>
<p>Because of the complexity of services required for management
 of HIV
infection, detailed information, particularly regarding medical
 care, is
beyond the scope of this report and may be found elsewhere
 (3,5,10,11).
Rather, this section provides information on diagnostic testing for
 HIV-1
and HIV-2, counseling patients who have HIV infection, and
 preparing the
HIV-infected patient for what to expect when medical care is
 necessary.
Information also is provided on management of sex partners, because
 such
services can and should be provided in the STD treatment facility
 before
referral. Finally, the topics of HIV infection during pregnancy and
 in
infants and children are addressed. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Testing for HIV-1 and HIV-2 </p>
<p>Testing for HIV should be offered to all persons whose behavior
 puts
them at risk for infection, including persons who seek evaluation
 and
treatment for STDs. Counseling before and after testing (i.e.,
 pretest and
posttest counseling) is an integral part of the testing procedure
 (see HIV
Prevention Counseling). Informed consent must be obtained before an
 HIV
test is performed. Some states require written consent. </p>
<p>HIV infection usually is diagnosed by using HIV-1 antibody
 tests.
Antibody testing begins with a sensitive screening test such as the
 enzyme
immunoassay (EIA). Reactive screening tests must be confirmed by a
supplemental test, such as the Western blot (WB) or an
 immunofluorescence
assay (IFA). If confirmed by a supplemental test, a positive
 antibody test
result indicates that a person is infected with HIV and is capable
 of
transmitting the virus to others. HIV antibody is detectable in at
 least
95% of patients within 6 months after infection. Although a
 negative
antibody test result usually indicates that a person is not
 infected,
antibody tests cannot exclude infection that occurred less than 6
 months
before the test. </p>
<p>The prevalence of HIV-2 in the United States is extremely low,
 and CDC
does not recommend routine testing for HIV-2 in settings other than
 blood
centers, unless demographic or behavioral information indicates
 that HIV-2
infection might be present. Those at risk for HIV-2 infection
 include
persons from a country in which HIV-2 is endemic or the sex
 partners of
such persons. HIV-2 is endemic in parts of West Africa, and an
 increased
prevalence of HIV-2 has been reported in Angola, France,
 Mozambique, and
Portugal. In addition, testing for HIV-2 should be conducted when
 there is
clinical evidence or suspicion of HIV disease in the absence of a
 positive
test for antibodies to HIV-1 (12). </p>
<p>Because HIV antibody crosses the placenta, its presence in a
 child aged
less than 18 months is not diagnostic of HIV infection (see Special

Considerations, HIV Infection in Infants and Children). </p>
<p>The following are specific recommendations for diagnostic
 testing for
HIV infection: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Informed consent must be obtained before an HIV test is
 performed. Some
    states require written consent. (See HIV Prevention Counseling
 for a
    discussion of pretest and posttest counseling.) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Positive screening tests for HIV antibody must be confirmed by
 a more
    specific confirmatory test (either WB or IFA) before being
 considered
    diagnostic of HIV infection. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Patients who have positive HIV test results must either receive

    behavioral, psychosocial, and medical evaluation and monitoring

    services or be referred for these services. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Acute Retroviral Syndrome </p>
<p>Health-care providers should be alert for the symptoms and
 signs of
acute retroviral syndrome, which is characterized by fever,
 malaise,
lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. This syndrome frequently occurs in
 the
first few weeks after HIV infection, before antibody test results
 become
positive. Suspicion of acute retroviral syndrome should prompt
 nucleic acid
testing to detect the presence of HIV. Recent data indicate that
 initiation
of antiretroviral therapy during this period can delay the onset of

HIV-related complications and might influence prognosis. If testing
 reveals
acute HIV infection, health-care providers should either counsel
 the
patient about immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy or
 refer the
patient for emergency expert consultation. The optimal
 antiretroviral
regimen at this time is unknown. Treatment with zidovudine can
 delay the
onset of HIV-related complications; however, most experts recommend

treatment with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and
 a
protease inhibitor. </p>
<p>Counseling for HIV-Infected Patients </p>
<p>Behavioral and psychosocial services are an integral part of
 health
care for HIV-infected patients; such services should be available
 on-site
or through referral when HIV infection is diagnosed. Patients often
 are
distressed when first informed of a positive HIV test result. Such
 patients
face several major adaptive challenges: a) accepting the
 possibility of a
shortened life span, b) coping with others' reactions to a
 stigmatizing
illness, c) developing and adopting strategies for maintaining
 physical and
emotional health, and d) initiating changes in behavior to prevent
 HIV
transmission to others. Many patients also require assistance with
 making
reproductive choices, gaining access to health services, and
 confronting
employment or housing discrimination. </p>
<p>Interrupting HIV transmission depends on behavioral changes
 made by
those persons at risk for transmitting or acquiring infection.
 Infected
persons, as potential sources of new infections, must receive
 additional
counseling and assistance to support partner notification and
 counseling to
prevent infection of others. Targeting behavior change programs
 toward
HIV-infected persons and their sex partners, or those with whom
 they share
injecting-drug equipment, is an important adjunct to AIDS
 prevention
efforts. </p>
<p>The following are specific recommendations for counseling
 HIV-infected
patients: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Persons who test positive for HIV antibody should be counseled
 by a
    person or persons, either on-site or through referral, who can
 discuss
    the behavioral, psychosocial, and medical implications of HIV
    infection. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Appropriate social support and psychological resources should
 be
    available, either on-site or through referral, to assist
 patients in
    coping with emotional distress. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Persons who continue to be at risk for transmitting HIV should
 receive
    assistance in changing or avoiding behaviors that can transmit
    infection to others. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Planning for Medical Care and for Continuation of Psychosocial
 Services </p>
<p>Practice settings for offering HIV care differ depending on
 local
resources and needs. Primary-care providers and outpatient
 facilities must
ensure that appropriate resources are available for each patient
 and must
avoid fragmentation of care as much as possible. A single source
 that is
able to provide comprehensive care for all stages of HIV infection
 is
preferred; however, the limited availability of such resources
 often
results in the need to coordinate care among outpatient, inpatient,
 and
specialist providers in different locations. Providers should do
 everything
possible to avoid fragmentation of care and long delays between
 diagnosis
of HIV infection and access to medical and psychosocial services. </p>
<p>Recently identified HIV infection may not have been recently
 acquired.
Persons newly diagnosed with HIV may be at any of the different
 stages of
infection. Therefore, the health-care provider should be alert for
 symptoms
or signs that suggest advanced HIV infection (e.g., fever, weight
 loss,
diarrhea, cough, shortness of breath, and oral candidiasis). The
 presence
of any of these symptoms should prompt urgent referral for medical
 care.
Similarly, the provider should be alert for signs of severe
 psychologic
distress and be prepared to refer the client accordingly. </p>
<p>HIV-infected patients in the STD treatment setting should be
 educated
about what to expect when medical care is necessary (11). In the
nonemergent situation, the initial evaluation of the HIV-positive
 patient
usually includes the following components: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    A detailed medical history, including sexual and
 substance-abuse
    history, previous STDs, and specific HIV-related symptoms or
 diagnoses. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A physical examination; for women, this should include a
 gynecologic
    examination. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    For women, testing for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, a Pap
 smear,
    and wet mount examination of vaginal secretions. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Complete blood and platelet counts and blood chemistry profile.
 </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Toxoplasma antibody test, tests for hepatitis B viral markers,
 and
    syphilis serology. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A CD4+ T-lymphocyte analysis and determination of HIV plasma
    ribonucleic acid (i.e., HIV viral load). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A tuberculin skin test (TST) (sometimes referred to as a
 purified
    protein derivative {PPD} skin test) administered by the Mantoux
 method.
    The test result should be evaluated at 48-72 hours; in
 HIV-infected
    persons, a 5 mm induration is considered positive. The
 usefulness of
    anergy testing is controversial (13-15). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A chest radiograph. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A thorough psychosocial evaluation, including ascertainment of
    behavioral factors indicating risk for transmitting HIV and
 elucidation
    of information concerning any partners who should be notified
 about
    possible exposure to HIV. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In subsequent visits, once the results of laboratory and skin
 tests are
available, the patient may be offered antiretroviral therapy (16),
 as well
as specific medications to reduce the incidence of opportunistic
 infections
(e.g., PCP, TE, disseminated MAC infection, and TB) (10,14,17-19).
Hepatitis B vaccination should be offered to patients who do not
 have
hepatitis B markers, influenza vaccination should be offered
 annually, and
pneumococcal vaccination should be administered. For additional
 information
concerning vaccination of HIV-infected patients, refer to
 &quot;Recommendations
of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP): Use of
 Vaccines
and Immune Globulins in Persons with Altered Immunocompetence&quot;
 (20). </p>
<p>Specific recommendations for planning medical care and
 continuation of
psychosocial services include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    HIV-infected persons should be referred for appropriate
 follow-up to
    facilities in which health-care personnel are experienced in
 providing
    care for HIV-infected patients. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Health-care providers should be alert for medical or
 psychosocial
    conditions that require immediate attention. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Patients should be educated about what to expect in follow-up
 medical
    care. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Management of Sex Partners and Injecting-Drug Partners </p>
<p>When referring to persons who are infected with HIV, the term
 &quot;partner&quot;
includes not only sex partners but also injecting-drug users who
 share
syringes or other injection equipment. The rationale for partner
notification is that the early diagnosis and treatment of HIV
 infection
possibly reduces morbidity and provides the opportunity to
 encourage
risk-reducing behaviors. Partner notification for HIV infection
 must be
confidential and will depend on voluntary cooperation of the
 patient. </p>
<p>Two complementary notification processes, patient referral and
 provider
referral, can be used to identify partners. With patient referral,
 patients
directly inform their partners of their exposure to HIV infection.
 With
provider referral, trained health department personnel locate
 partners on
the basis of the names, descriptions, and addresses provided by the

patient. During the notification process, the anonymity of patients
 is
protected; their names are not revealed to partners who are
 notified. Many
state health departments provide assistance, if requested, with
provider-referral partner notification. </p>
<p>The results of one randomized trial suggested that provider
 referral is
more effective in notifying partners than patient referral. In that
 study,
50% of partners in the provider-referral group were notified,
 compared with
7% of partners notified by persons in the patient-referral group.
 However,
whether behavioral change takes place as a result of partner
 notification
has not been determined, and many patients are reluctant to
 disclose the
names of partners because of concern about discrimination,
 disruption of
relationships, loss of confidentiality for the partners, and
 possible
violence. </p>
<p>The following are specific recommendations for implementing
partner-notification procedures: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    HIV-infected patients should be encouraged to notify their
 partners and
    to refer them for counseling and testing. If requested by the
 patient,
    health-care providers should assist in this process, either
 directly or
    by referral to health department partner-notification programs.
 </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    If patients are unwilling to notify their partners, or if they
 cannot
    ensure that their partners will seek counseling, physicians or
 health
    department personnel should use confidential procedures to
 notify the
    partners. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>All pregnant women should be offered HIV testing as early in
 pregnancy
as possible (21). This recommendation is particularly important
 because of
the available treatments for reducing the likelihood of perinatal
transmission and maintaining the health of the woman. HIV-infected
 women
should be informed specifically about the risk for perinatal
 infection.
Current evidence indicates that 15%-25% of infants born to
 untreated
HIV-infected mothers are infected with HIV; the virus also can be
transmitted from an infected mother by breastfeeding. Zidovudine
 (ZDV)
reduces the risk for HIV transmission to the infant from
 approximately 25%
to 8% if administered to women during the later stage of pregnancy
 and
during labor and to infants for the first 6 weeks of life (22).
 Therefore,
ZDV treatment should be offered to all HIV-infected pregnant women.
 In the
United States, HIV-infected women should be advised not to
 breastfeed their
infants. </p>
<p>Insufficient information is available regarding the safety of
 ZDV or
other antiretroviral drugs during early pregnancy; however, on the
 basis of
the ACTG-076 protocol, * ZDV is indicated for the prevention of
maternal-fetal HIV transmission as part of a regimen that includes
 oral ZDV
at 14-34 weeks of gestation, intravenous (IV) ZDV during labor, and
 ZDV
Syrup to the neonate after birth (22). Glaxo Wellcome, Inc.,
Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Co., and Merck &amp; Co.,
 Inc.,
in cooperation with CDC, maintain a registry to assess the safety
 of ZDV,
didanosine (ddI), lamivudine (3TC), saquinavir (SAQ), stavudine
 (d4t), and
dideoxycytodine (ddC) during pregnancy. Women who receive any of
 these
drugs during pregnancy should be reported to this registry;
 telephone (800)
722-9292, extension 38465. The number of cases reported through
 February
1997 represented a sample of insufficient size for reliably
 estimating the
risk for birth defects after administration of ddI, 3TC, SAQ, d4t,
 ddC, or
ZDV, or their combination, to pregnant women and their fetuses.
 However,
the registry findings did not indicate an increase in the number of
 birth
defects after receipt of only ZDV in comparison with the number
 expected in
the U.S. population. Furthermore, no consistent pattern of birth
 defects
has been observed that would suggest a common cause. </p>
<p>Women should be counseled about their options regarding
 pregnancy. The
objective of counseling is to provide HIV-infected women with
 information
for making reproductive decisions, analogous to the model used in
 genetic
counseling. In addition, contraceptive counseling should be offered
 to
HIV-infected women who do not desire pregnancy. Prenatal and
 abortion
services should be available on-site or by referral. Pregnancy
 among
HIV-infected women does not appear to increase maternal morbidity
 or
mortality.

<br>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>HIV Infection in Infants and Children </p>
<p>HIV-infected infants and young children differ from adults and
adolescents with respect to the diagnosis, clinical presentation,
 and
management of HIV disease. For example, because of transplacental
 passage
of maternal HIV antibody, both infected and uninfected infants born
 to
HIV-infected mothers are expected to have positive HIV-antibody
 test
results. A definitive determination of HIV infection in a child
 less than
18 months of age should be based on laboratory evidence of HIV in
 blood or
tissues by culture, nucleic acid, or antigen detection. In
 addition, CD4+
lymphocyte counts are higher in infants and children aged less than
 5 years
than in healthy adults and must be interpreted accordingly. All
 infants
born to HIV-infected mothers should begin PCP prophylaxis at age
 4-6 weeks;
such prophylaxis should be continued until HIV infection has been
 excluded
(18). Other modifications must be made in health services that are
recommended for infants and children, such as avoiding vaccination
 with
live oral polio vaccine when a child (or household contact) is
 infected
with HIV. Management of infants, children, and adolescents who are
 known or
suspected to be infected with HIV requires referral to physicians
 familiar
with the manifestations and treatment of pediatric HIV infection. </p>
<br>
<p>DISEASES CHARACTERIZED BY GENITAL ULCERS </p>
<p>Management of Patients Who Have Genital Ulcers </p>
<p>In the United States, most young, sexually active patients who
 have
genital ulcers have either genital herpes, syphilis, or chancroid.
 The
relative frequency of each differs by geographic area and patient
population; however, in most areas of the United States, genital
 herpes is
the most prevalent of these diseases. More than one of these
 diseases could
be present in a patient who has genital ulcers. Each disease has
 been
associated with an increased risk for HIV infection. </p>
<p>A diagnosis based only on the patient's medical history and
 physical
examination often is inaccurate. Therefore, evaluation of all
 patients who
have genital ulcers should include a serologic test for syphilis
 and
diagnostic evaluation for herpes. Although, ideally, all of these
 tests
should be conducted for each patient who has a genital ulcer, use
 of such
tests (other than a serologic test for syphilis) may be based on
 test
availability and clinical or epidemiologic suspicion. Specific
 tests for
the evaluation of genital ulcers include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Darkfield examination or direct immunofluorescence test for
 Treponema
    pallidum, </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Culture or antigen test for HSV, and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Culture for Haemophilus ducreyi. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for these organisms might
 become
available commercially. </p>
<p>HIV testing should be a) performed in the management of
 patients who
have genital ulcers caused by T. pallidum or H. ducreyi and b)
 considered
for those who have ulcers caused by HSV (see sections on Syphilis,
Chancroid, and Genital Herpes). </p>
<p>A health-care provider often must treat a patient before test
 results
are available. In such a circumstance, the clinician should treat
 for the
diagnosis considered most likely. If the diagnosis is unclear, many
 experts
recommend treatment for syphilis, or for both syphilis and
 chancroid if the
patient resides in a community in which H. ducreyi is a significant
 cause
of genital ulcers, especially when diagnostic capabilities for
 chancroid or
syphilis are not ideal. However, even after complete diagnostic
 evaluation,
at least 25% of patients who have genital ulcers have no
laboratory-confirmed diagnosis. </p>
<p>Chancroid </p>
<p>Chancroid is endemic in some areas of the United States, and
 the
disease also occurs in discrete outbreaks. Chancroid is a cofactor
 for HIV
transmission, and high rates of HIV infection among patients who
 have
chancroid have been reported in the United States and other
 countries. An
estimated 10% of patients who have chancroid could be coinfected
 with T.
pallidum or HSV. </p>
<p>A definitive diagnosis of chancroid requires identification of
 H.
ducreyi on special culture media that are not widely available from

commercial sources; even using these media, sensitivity is less
 than or
equal to 80%. A probable diagnosis, for both clinical and
 surveillance
purposes, may be made if the following criteria are met: a) the
 patient has
one or more painful genital ulcers; b) the patient has no evidence
 of T.
pallidum infection by darkfield examination of ulcer exudate or by
 a
serologic test for syphilis performed at least 7 days after onset
 of
ulcers; and c) the clinical presentation, appearance of genital
 ulcers, and
regional lymphadenopathy, if present, are typical for chancroid and
 a test
for HSV is negative. The combination of a painful ulcer and tender
 inguinal
adenopathy, which occurs among one third of patients, suggests a
 diagnosis
of chancroid; when accompanied by suppurative inguinal adenopathy,
 these
signs are almost pathognomonic. PCR testing for H. ducreyi might
 become
available soon. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Successful treatment for chancroid cures the infection,
 resolves the
clinical symptoms, and prevents transmission to others. In
 extensive cases,
scarring can result despite successful therapy. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose,
OR
Ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly (IM) in a single dose,
OR
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day for 3 days,
OR
Erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>NOTE: Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated for pregnant and lactating
 women and
for persons aged less than 18 years. </p>
<p>All four regimens are effective for treatment of chancroid in
HIV-infected patients. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone offer the
 advantage of
single-dose therapy. Worldwide, several isolates with intermediate
resistance to either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin have been
 reported. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Patients who are uncircumcised and HIV-infected patients might
 not
respond as well to treatment as those who are circumcised or
 HIV-negative.
Patients should be tested for HIV infection at the time chancroid
 is
diagnosed. Patients should be retested 3 months after the diagnosis
 of
chancroid if the initial test results for syphilis and HIV were
 negative. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients should be reexamined 3-7 days after initiation of
 therapy. If
treatment is successful, ulcers improve symptomatically within 3
 days and
objectively within 7 days after therapy. If no clinical improvement
 is
evident, the clinician must consider whether a) the diagnosis is
 correct,
b) the patient is coinfected with another STD, c) the patient is
 infected
with HIV, d) the treatment was not taken as instructed, or e) the
 H.
ducreyi strain causing the infection is resistant to the prescribed

antimicrobial. The time required for complete healing depends on
 the size
of the ulcer; large ulcers may require greater than 2 weeks. In
 addition,
healing is slower for some uncircumcised men who have ulcers under
 the
foreskin. Clinical resolution of fluctuant lymphadenopathy is
 slower than
that of ulcers and may require drainage, even during otherwise
 successful
therapy. Although needle aspiration of buboes is a simpler
 procedure,
incision and drainage of buboes may be preferred because of less
 need for
subsequent drainage procedures. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Sex partners of patients who have chancroid should be examined
 and
treated, regardless of whether symptoms of the disease are present,
 if they
had sexual contact with the patient during the 10 days preceding
 onset of
symptoms in the patient. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>The safety of azithromycin for pregnant and lactating women has
 not
been established. Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated during
 pregnancy. No
adverse effects of chancroid on pregnancy outcome or on the fetus
 have been
reported. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>HIV-infected patients who have chancroid should be monitored
 closely.
Such patients may require longer courses of therapy than those
 recommended
for HIV-negative patients. Healing may be slower among HIV-infected

patients, and treatment failures occur with any regimen. Because
 data are
limited concerning the therapeutic efficacy of the recommended
 ceftriaxone
and azithromycin regimens in HIV-infected patients, these regimens
 should
be used for such patients only if follow-up can be ensured. Some
 experts
suggest using the erythromycin 7-day regimen for treating
 HIV-infected
persons. </p>
<p>Genital Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection </p>
<p>Genital herpes is a recurrent, incurable viral disease. Two
 serotypes
of HSV have been identified: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Most cases of
 recurrent
genital herpes are caused by HSV-2. On the basis of serologic
 studies,
genital HSV-2 infection has been diagnosed in at least 45 million
 persons
in the United States. </p>
<p>Most HSV-2-infected persons have not received a diagnosis of
 genital
herpes. Such persons have mild or unrecognized infections that shed
 virus
intermittently in the genital tract. Some cases of first-episode
 genital
herpes are manifested by severe disease that might require
 hospitalization.
Many cases of genital herpes are transmitted by persons who are
 unaware
that they have the infection or are asymptomatic when transmission
 occurs. </p>
<p>Systemic antiviral drugs partially control the symptoms and
 signs of
herpes episodes when used to treat first clinical episodes or
 recurrent
episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy. However, these
 drugs
neither eradicate latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or
 severity
of recurrences after the drug is discontinued. Randomized trials
 indicate
that three antiviral medications provide clinical benefit for
 genital
herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Valacyclovir is a
 valine
ester of acyclovir with enhanced absorption after oral
 administration.
Famciclovir, a prodrug of penciclovir, also has high oral
 bioavailability.
Topical therapy with acyclovir is substantially less effective than
 the
systemic drug, and its use is discouraged. The recommended
 acyclovir dosing
regimens for both initial and recurrent episodes reflect
 substantial
clinical experience, expert opinion, and FDA-approved dosages. </p>
<p>First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes </p>
<p>Management of patients with first clinical episode of genital
 herpes
includes antiviral therapy and counseling regarding the natural
 history of
genital herpes, sexual and perinatal transmission, and methods to
 reduce
such transmission. Five percent to 30% of first-episode cases of
 genital
herpes are caused by HSV-1, but clinical recurrences are much less
 frequent
for HSV-1 than HSV-2 genital infection. Therefore, identification
 of the
type of the infecting strain has prognostic importance and may be
 useful
for counseling purposes. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Acyclovir 400 mg orally three times a day for 7-10 days,
OR
Acyclovir 200 mg orally five times a day for 7-10 days,
OR
Famciclovir 250 mg orally three times a day for 7-10 days,
OR
Valacyclovir 1 g orally twice a day for 7-10 days. </p>
<p>NOTE: Treatment may be extended if healing is incomplete after 10
 days of
therapy. </p>
<p>Higher dosages of acyclovir (i.e., 400 mg orally five times a
 day) were
used in treatment studies of first-episode herpes proctitis and
first-episode oral infection, including stomatitis or pharyngitis.
 It is
unclear whether these forms of mucosal infection require higher
 doses of
acyclovir than used for genital herpes. Valacyclovir and
 famciclovir
probably are also effective for acute HSV proctitis or oral
 infection, but
clinical experience is lacking. </p>
<p>Counseling is an important aspect of managing patients who have
 genital
herpes. Although initial counseling can be provided at the first
 visit,
many patients benefit from learning about the chronic aspects of
 the
disease after the acute illness subsides. Counseling of these
 patients
should include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Patients who have genital herpes should be told about the
 natural
    history of the disease, with emphasis on the potential for
 recurrent
    episodes, asymptomatic viral shedding, and sexual transmission.
 </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Patients should be advised to abstain from sexual activity when
 lesions
    or prodromal symptoms are present and encouraged to inform
 their sex
    partners that they have genital herpes. The use of condoms
 during all
    sexual exposures with new or uninfected sex partners should be
    encouraged. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Sexual transmission of HSV can occur during asymptomatic
 periods.
    Asymptomatic viral shedding occurs more frequently in patients
 who have
    genital HSV-2 infection than HSV-1 infection and in patients
 who have
    had genital herpes for less than 12 months. Such patients
 should be
    counseled to prevent spread of the infection. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The risk for neonatal infection should be explained to all
 patients,
    including men. Childbearing-aged women who have genital herpes
 should
    be advised to inform health-care providers who care for them
 during
    pregnancy about the HSV infection. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Patients having a first episode of genital herpes should be
 advised
    that a) episodic antiviral therapy during recurrent episodes
 might
    shorten the duration of lesions and b) suppressive antiviral
 therapy
    can ameliorate or prevent recurrent outbreaks. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Recurrent Episodes of HSV Disease </p>
<p>Most patients with first-episode genital HSV-2 infection will
 have
recurrent episodes of genital lesions. Episodic or suppressive
 antiviral
therapy might shorten the duration of lesions or ameliorate
 recurrences.
Because many patients benefit from antiviral therapy, options for
 treatment
should be discussed with all patients. </p>
<p>When treatment is started during the prodrome or within 1 day
 after
onset of lesions, many patients who have recurrent disease benefit
 from
episodic therapy. If episodic treatment of recurrences is chosen,
 the
patient should be provided with antiviral therapy, or a
 prescription for
the medication, so that treatment can be initiated at the first
 sign of
prodrome or genital lesions. </p>
<p>Daily suppressive therapy reduces the frequency of genital
 herpes
recurrences by greater than or equal to 75% among patients who have

frequent recurrences (i.e., six or more recurrences per year).
 Safety and
efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily
 therapy with
acyclovir for as long as 6 years, and with valacyclovir and
 famciclovir for
1 year. Suppressive therapy has not been associated with emergence
 of
clinically significant acyclovir resistance among immunocompetent
 patients.
After 1 year of continuous suppressive therapy, discontinuation of
 therapy
should be discussed with the patient to assess the patient's
 psychological
adjustment to genital herpes and rate of recurrent episodes, as the

frequency of recurrences decreases over time in many patients.
 Insufficient
experience with famciclovir and valacyclovir prevents
 recommendation of
these drugs for greater than 1 year. </p>
<p>Suppressive treatment with acyclovir reduces but does not
 eliminate
asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, the extent to which
 suppressive
therapy may prevent HSV transmission is unknown. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens for Episodic Recurrent Infection </p>
<p>Acyclovir 400 mg orally three times a day for 5 days,
OR
Acyclovir 200 mg orally five times a day for 5 days,
OR
Acyclovir 800 mg orally twice a day for 5 days,
OR
Famciclovir 125 mg orally twice a day for 5 days,
OR
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally twice a day for 5 days. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens for Daily Suppressive Therapy </p>
<p>Acyclovir 400 mg orally twice a day,
OR
Famciclovir 250 mg orally twice a day,
OR
Valacyclovir 250 mg orally twice a day,
OR
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally once a day,
OR
Valacyclovir 1,000 mg orally once a day. </p>
<p>Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day appears less effective than
 other
valacyclovir dosing regimens in patients who have very frequent
 recurrences
(i.e., greater than or equal to 10 episodes per year). Few
 comparative
studies of valacyclovir and famciclovir with acyclovir have been
 conducted.
The results of these studies suggest that valacyclovir and
 famciclovir are
comparable to acyclovir in clinical outcome. However, valacyclovir
 and
famciclovir may provide increased ease in administration, which is
 an
important consideration for prolonged treatment. </p>
<p>Severe Disease </p>
<p>IV therapy should be provided for patients who have severe
 disease or
complications necessitating hospitalization, such as disseminated
infection, pneumonitis, hepatitis, or complications of the central
 nervous
system (e.g., meningitis or encephalitis). </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Acyclovir 5-10 mg/kg body weight IV every 8 hours for 5-7 days
 or until
clinical resolution is attained. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>The sex partners of patients who have genital herpes are likely
 to
benefit from evaluation and counseling. Symptomatic sex partners
 should be
evaluated and treated in the same manner as patients who have
 genital
lesions. However, most persons who have genital HSV infection do
 not have a
history of typical genital lesions. These persons and their future
 sex
partners may benefit from evaluation and counseling. Thus, even
asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have newly diagnosed
 genital
herpes should be questioned concerning histories of typical and
 atypical
genital lesions, and they should be encouraged to examine
 themselves for
lesions in the future and seek medical attention promptly if
 lesions
appear. </p>
<p>Most of the available HSV antibody tests do not accurately
 discriminate
between HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies, and their use is not currently
recommended. Sensitive and type-specific serum antibody assays may
 become
commercially available and contribute to future intervention
 strategies. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions </p>
<p>Allergic and other adverse reactions to acyclovir,
 valacyclovir, and
famciclovir are infrequent. Desensitization to acyclovir has been
 described
previously (23). </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Immunocompromised patients might have prolonged and/or severe
 episodes
of genital or perianal herpes. Lesions caused by HSV are relatively
 common
among HIV-infected patients and may be severe, painful, and
 atypical.
Intermittent or suppressive therapy with oral antiviral agents is
 often
beneficial. </p>
<p>The dosage of antiviral drugs for HIV-infected patients is
controversial, but clinical experience strongly suggests that
immunocompromised patients benefit from increased doses of
 antiviral drugs.
Regimens such as acyclovir 400 mg orally three to five times a day,
 as used
for other immunocompromised patients, have been useful. Therapy
 should be
continued until clinical resolution is attained. Famciclovir 500 mg
 twice a
day has been effective in decreasing both the rate of recurrences
 and the
rate of subclinical shedding among HIV-infected patients. In
immunocompromised patients, valacyclovir in doses of 8 g per day
 has been
associated with a syndrome resembling either hemolytic uremic
 syndrome or
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, in the doses
 recommended for
treatment of genital herpes, valacyclovir, acyclovir, and
 famciclovir
probably are safe for use in immunocompromised patients. For severe
 cases,
acyclovir 5 mg/kg IV every 8 hours may be required. </p>
<p>If lesions persist in a patient receiving acyclovir treatment,
resistance of the HSV strain to acyclovir should be suspected. Such

patients should be managed in consultation with an expert. For
 severe cases
caused by proven or suspected acyclovir-resistant strains,
 alternate
therapy should be administered. All acyclovir-resistant strains are

resistant to valacyclovir, and most are resistant to famciclovir.
Foscarnet, 40 mg/kg body weight IV every 8 hours until clinical
 resolution
is attained, is often effective for treatment of
 acyclovir-resistant
genital herpes. Topical cidofovir gel 1% applied to the lesions
 once daily
for 5 consecutive days also might be effective. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>The safety of systemic acyclovir and valacyclovir therapy in
 pregnant
women has not been established. Glaxo-Wellcome, Inc., in
 cooperation with
CDC, maintains a registry to assess the use and effects of
 acyclovir and
valacyclovir during pregnancy. Women who receive acyclovir or
 valacyclovir
during pregnancy should be reported to this registry; telephone
 (800)
722-9292, extension 38465. </p>
<p>Current registry findings do not indicate an increased risk for
 major
birth defects after acyclovir treatment (i.e., in comparison with
 the
general population). These findings provide some assurance in
 counseling
women who have had prenatal exposure to acyclovir. The accumulated
 case
histories represent an insufficient sample for reaching reliable
 and
definitive conclusions regarding the risks associated with
 acyclovir
treatment during pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to valacyclovir and
famciclovir is too limited to provide useful information on
 pregnancy
outcomes. </p>
<p>The first clinical episode of genital herpes during pregnancy
 may be
treated with oral acyclovir. In the presence of life-threatening
 maternal
HSV infection (e.g., disseminated infection, encephalitis,
 pneumonitis, or
hepatitis), acyclovir administered IV is indicated. Investigations
 of
acyclovir use among pregnant women suggest that acyclovir treatment
 near
term might reduce the rate of abdominal deliveries among women who
 have
frequently recurring or newly acquired genital herpes by decreasing
 the
incidence of active lesions. However, routine administration of
 acyclovir
to pregnant women who have a history of recurrent genital herpes is
 not
recommended at this time. </p>
<p>Perinatal Infection </p>
<p>Most mothers of infants who acquire neonatal herpes lack
 histories of
clinically evident genital herpes. The risk for transmission to the
 neonate
from an infected mother is high among women who acquire genital
 herpes near
the time of delivery (30%-50%) and is low among women who have a
 history of
recurrent herpes at term and women who acquire genital HSV during
 the first
half of pregnancy (3%). Therefore, prevention of neonatal herpes
 should
emphasize prevention of acquisition of genital HSV infection during
 late
pregnancy. Susceptible women whose partners have oral or genital
 HSV
infection, or those whose sex partners' infection status is
 unknown, should
be counseled to avoid unprotected genital and oral sexual contact
 during
late pregnancy. The results of viral cultures during pregnancy do
 not
predict viral shedding at the time of delivery, and such cultures
 are not
indicated routinely. </p>
<p>At the onset of labor, all women should be examined and
 carefully
questioned regarding whether they have symptoms of genital herpes.
 Infants
of women who do not have symptoms or signs of genital herpes
 infection or
its prodrome may be delivered vaginally. Abdominal delivery does
 not
completely eliminate the risk for HSV infection in the neonate. </p>
<p>Infants exposed to HSV during birth, as proven by virus
 isolation or
presumed by observation of lesions, should be followed carefully.
 Some
authorities recommend that such infants undergo surveillance
 cultures of
mucosal surfaces to detect HSV infection before development of
 clinical
signs. Available data do not support the routine use of acyclovir
 for
asymptomatic infants exposed during birth through an infected birth
 canal,
because the risk for infection in most infants is low. However,
 infants
born to women who acquired genital herpes near term are at high
 risk for
neonatal herpes, and some experts recommend acyclovir therapy for
 these
infants. Such pregnancies and newborns should be managed in
 consultation
with an expert. All infants who have evidence of neonatal herpes
 should be
promptly evaluated and treated with systemic acyclovir (19).
 Acyclovir 30-60 mg/ </p>
<p>Granuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis) </p>
<p>Granuloma inguinale, a rare disease in the United States, is
 caused by
the intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Calymmatobacterium
 granulomatis.
The disease is endemic in certain tropical and developing areas,
 including
India, Papua New Guinea, central Australia, and southern Africa.
 The
disease presents clinically as painless, progressive, ulcerative
 lesions
without regional lymphadenopathy. The lesions are highly vascular
 (i.e., a
beefy red appearance) and bleed easily on contact. The causative
 organism
cannot be cultured on standard microbiologic media, and diagnosis
 requires
visualization of dark-staining Donovan bodies on tissue crush
 preparation
or biopsy. A secondary bacterial infection might develop in the
 lesions, or
the lesions might be coinfected with another sexually transmitted
 pathogen. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Treatment appears to halt progressive destruction of tissue,
 although
prolonged duration of therapy often is required to enable
 granulation and
re-epithelialization of the ulcers. Relapse can occur 6-18 months
 later
despite effective initial therapy. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole one double-strength tablet orally
 twice a
day for a minimum of 3 weeks,
OR
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for a minimum of 3 weeks.
 </p>
<p>Therapy should be continued until all lesions have healed
 completely. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimens </p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally twice a day for a minimum of 3
 weeks,
OR
Erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day for a minimum
 of 3
weeks. </p>
<p>For any of the above regimens, the addition of an aminoglycoside
(gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours) should be considered if
 lesions do
not respond within the first few days of therapy. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms
 have
resolved. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Sex partners of patients who have granuloma inguinale should be

examined and treated if they a) had sexual contact with the patient
 during
the 60 days preceding the onset of symptoms in the patient and b)
 have
clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnancy is a relative contraindication to the use of
 sulfonamides.
Both pregnant and lactating women should be treated with the
 erythromycin
regimen. The addition of a parenteral aminoglycoside (e.g.,
 gentamicin)
should be strongly considered. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>HIV-infected persons who have granuloma inguinale should be
 treated
following the regimens cited previously. The addition of a
 parenteral
aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin) should be strongly considered. </p>
<p>Lymphogranuloma Venereum </p>
<p>Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a rare disease in the United
 States, is
caused by the invasive serovars L1, L2, or L3 of C. trachomatis.
 The most
frequent clinical manifestation of LGV among heterosexual men is
 tender
inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy that is usually unilateral.
 Women
and homosexually active men might have proctocolitis or
 inflammatory
involvement of perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues that can
 result in
fistulas and strictures. When most patients seek medical care, they
 no
longer have the self-limited genital ulcer that sometimes occurs at
 the
inoculation site. The diagnosis usually is made serologically and
 by
exclusion of other causes of inguinal lymphadenopathy or genital
 ulcers. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Treatment cures infection and prevents ongoing tissue damage,
 although
tissue reaction can result in scarring. Buboes may require
 aspiration
through intact skin or incision and drainage to prevent the
 formation of
inguinal/femoral ulcerations. Doxycycline is the preferred
 treatment. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 21 days. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimen </p>
<p>Erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day for 21 days. </p>
<p>The activity of azithromycin against C. trachomatis suggests that
 it may be
effective in multiple doses over 2-3 weeks, but clinical data
 regarding its
use are lacking. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms
 have
resolved. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Sex partners of patients who have LGV should be examined,
 tested for
urethral or cervical chlamydial infection, and treated if they had
 sexual
contact with the patient during the 30 days preceding onset of
 symptoms in
the patient. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnant women should be treated with the erythromycin regimen.
 </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>HIV-infected persons who have LGV should be treated according
 to the
regimens cited previously. Anecdotal evidence suggests that LGV
 infection
in HIV-positive patients may require prolonged therapy and that
 resolution
might be delayed. </p>
<p>Syphilis </p>
<p>General Principles </p>
<p>Background </p>
<p>Syphilis is a systemic disease caused by T. pallidum. Patients
 who have
syphilis may seek treatment for signs or symptoms of primary
 infection
(i.e., ulcer or chancre at the infection site), secondary infection
 (i.e.,
manifestations that include rash, mucocutaneous lesions, and
 adenopathy),
or tertiary infection (i.e., cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmic,
 auditory, or
gummatous lesions). Infections also may be detected by serologic
 testing
during the latent stage. Latent syphilis acquired within the
 preceding year
is referred to as early latent syphilis; all other cases of latent
 syphilis
are either late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration.
 Treatment
for late latent syphilis, as well as tertiary syphilis,
 theoretically may
require a longer duration of therapy because organisms are dividing
 more
slowly; however, the validity and importance of this concept have
 not been
determined. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations and Use of Serologic Tests </p>
<p>Darkfield examinations and direct fluorescent antibody tests of
 lesion
exudate or tissue are the definitive methods for diagnosing early
 syphilis.
A presumptive diagnosis is possible with the use of two types of
 serologic
tests for syphilis: a) nontreponemal (e.g., Venereal Disease
 Research
Laboratory {VDRL} and RPR) and b) treponemal (e.g., fluorescent
 treponemal
antibody absorbed {FTA-ABS} and microhemagglutination assay for
 antibody to
T. pallidum {MHA-TP}). The use of only one type of test is
 insufficient for
diagnosis because false-positive nontreponemal test results
 occasionally
occur secondary to various medical conditions. Nontreponemal test
 antibody
titers usually correlate with disease activity, and results should
 be
reported quantitatively. A fourfold change in titer, equivalent to
 a change
of two dilutions (e.g., from 1:16 to 1:4 or from 1:8 to 1:32),
 usually is
considered necessary to demonstrate a clinically significant
 difference
between two nontreponemal test results that were obtained by using
 the same
serologic test. It is expected that the nontreponemal test will
 eventually
become nonreactive after treatment; however, in some patients,
nontreponemal antibodies can persist at a low titer for a long
 period,
sometimes for the remainder of their lives. This response is
 referred to as
the serofast reaction. Most patients who have reactive treponemal
 tests
will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives,
 regardless of
treatment or disease activity. However, 15%-25% of patients treated
 during
the primary stage might revert to being serologically nonreactive
 after 2-3
years. Treponemal test antibody titers correlate poorly with
 disease
activity and should not be used to assess treatment response. </p>
<p>Sequential serologic tests should be performed by using the
 same
testing method (e.g., VDRL or RPR), preferably by the same
 laboratory. The
VDRL and RPR are equally valid, but quantitative results from the
 two tests
cannot be compared directly because RPR titers often are slightly
 higher
than VDRL titers. </p>
<p>HIV-infected patients can have abnormal serologic test results
 (i.e.,
unusually high, unusually low, and fluctuating titers). For such
 patients
with clinical syndromes suggestive of early syphilis, use of other
 tests
(e.g., biopsy and direct microscopy) should be considered. However,
 for
most HIV-infected patients, serologic tests appear to be accurate
 and
reliable for the diagnosis of syphilis and for evaluation of
 treatment
response. </p>
<p>No single test can be used to diagnose all cases of
 neurosyphilis. The
diagnosis of neurosyphilis can be made based on various
 combinations of
reactive serologic test results, abnormalities of cerebrospinal
 fluid (CSF)
cell count or protein, or a reactive VDRL-CSF with or without
 clinical
manifestations. The CSF leukocyte count usually is elevated
 (greater than 5
WBCs/mm3) when neurosyphilis is present, and it also is a sensitive
 measure
of the effectiveness of therapy. The VDRL-CSF is the standard
 serologic
test for CSF; when reactive in the absence of substantial
 contamination of
CSF with blood, it is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis.
 However, the
VDRL-CSF may be nonreactive when neurosyphilis is present. Some
 experts
recommend performing an FTA-ABS test on CSF. The CSF FTA-ABS is
 less
specific (i.e., yields more false-positive results) for
 neurosyphilis than
the VDRL-CSF. However, the test is believed to be highly sensitive,
 and
some experts believe that a negative CSF FTA-ABS test excludes
neurosyphilis. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Parenteral penicillin G is the preferred drug for treatment of
 all
stages of syphilis. The preparation(s) used (i.e., benzathine,
 aqueous
procaine, or aqueous crystalline), the dosage, and the length of
 treatment
depend on the stage and clinical manifestations of disease. </p>
<p>The efficacy of penicillin for the treatment of syphilis was
 well
established through clinical experience before the value of
 randomized
controlled clinical trials was recognized. Therefore, almost all
 the
recommendations for the treatment of syphilis are based on expert
 opinion
reinforced by case series, clinical trials, and 50 years of
 clinical
experience. </p>
<p>Parenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented
 efficacy
for neurosyphilis or for syphilis during pregnancy. Patients who
 report a
penicillin allergy, including pregnant women with syphilis in any
 stage and
patients with neurosyphilis, should be desensitized and treated
 with
penicillin. Skin testing for penicillin allergy may be useful in
 some
settings (see Management of Patients Who Have a History of
 Penicillin
Allergy), because the minor determinants needed for penicillin skin
 testing
are unavailable commercially. </p>
<p>The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction --
 often
accompanied by headache, myalgia, and other symptoms -- that might
 occur
within the first 24 hours after any therapy for syphilis; patients
 should
be advised of this possible adverse reaction. The
 Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction often occurs among patients who have early syphilis.
 Antipyretics
may be recommended, but no proven methods prevent this reaction.
 The
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction may induce early labor or cause fetal
 distress
among pregnant women. This concern should not prevent or delay
 therapy (see
Syphilis During Pregnancy). </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Sexual transmission of T. pallidum occurs only when
 mucocutaneous
syphilitic lesions are present; such manifestations are uncommon
 after the
first year of infection. However, persons exposed sexually to a
 patient who
has syphilis in any stage should be evaluated clinically and
 serologically
according to the following recommendations: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Persons who were exposed within the 90 days preceding the
 diagnosis of
    primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis in a sex partner
 might be
    infected even if seronegative; therefore, such persons should
 be
    treated presumptively. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Persons who were exposed greater than 90 days before the
 diagnosis of
    primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis in a sex partner
 should be
    treated presumptively if serologic test results are not
 available
    immediately and the opportunity for follow-up is uncertain. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    For purposes of partner notification and presumptive treatment
 of
    exposed sex partners, patients with syphilis of unknown
 duration who
    have high nontreponemal serologic test titers (i.e., greater
 than or
    equal to 1:32) may be considered as having early syphilis.
 However,
    serologic titers should not be used to differentiate early from
 late
    latent syphilis for the purpose of determining treatment (see
 section
    regarding treatment of latent syphilis). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Long-term sex partners of patients who have late syphilis
 should be
    evaluated clinically and serologically for syphilis and treated
 on the
    basis of the findings of the evaluation. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The time periods before treatment used for identifying at-risk
 sex
partners are a) 3 months plus duration of symptoms for primary
 syphilis, b)
6 months plus duration of symptoms for secondary syphilis, and c) 1
 year
for early latent syphilis. </p>
<p>Primary and Secondary Syphilis </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Parenteral penicillin G has been used effectively for four
 decades to
achieve a local cure (i.e., healing of lesions and prevention of
 sexual
transmission) and to prevent late sequelae. However, no adequately
conducted comparative trials have been performed to guide the
 selection of
an optimal penicillin regimen (i.e., the dose, duration, and
 preparation).
Substantially fewer data are available concerning nonpenicillin
 regimens. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen for Adults </p>
<p>Patients who have primary or secondary syphilis should be
 treated with
the following regimen: </p>
<p>Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a single dose. </p>
<p>NOTE: Recommendations for treating pregnant women and HIV-infected
 patients
for syphilis are discussed in separate sections. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen for Children </p>
<p>After the newborn period, children in whom syphilis is
 diagnosed should
have a CSF examination to detect asymptomatic neurosyphilis, and
 birth and
maternal medical records should be reviewed to assess whether the
 child has
congenital or acquired syphilis (see Congenital Syphilis). Children
 with
acquired primary or secondary syphilis should be evaluated
 (including
consultation with child-protection services) and treated by using
 the
following pediatric regimen (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of
 Children). </p>
<p>Benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg IM, up to the adult
 dose of 2.4
million units in a single dose. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>All patients who have syphilis should be tested for HIV
 infection. In
geographic areas in which the prevalence of HIV is high, patients
 who have
primary syphilis should be retested for HIV after 3 months if the
 first HIV
test result was negative. This recommendation will become
 particularly
important if it can be demonstrated that intensive antiviral
 therapy
administered soon after HIV seroconversion is beneficial. </p>
<p>Patients who have syphilis and who also have symptoms or signs
suggesting neurologic disease (e.g., meningitis) or ophthalmic
 disease
(e.g., uveitis) should be evaluated fully for neurosyphilis and
 syphilitic
eye disease; this evaluation should include CSF analysis and ocular

slit-lamp examination. Such patients should be treated
 appropriately
according to the results of this evaluation. </p>
<p>Invasion of CSF by T. pallidum accompanied by CSF abnormalities
 is
common among adults who have primary or secondary syphilis.
 However,
neurosyphilis develops in only a few patients after treatment with
 the
regimens described in this report. Therefore, unless clinical signs
 or
symptoms of neurologic or ophthalmic involvement are present,
 lumbar
puncture is not recommended for routine evaluation of patients who
 have
primary or secondary syphilis. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Treatment failures can occur with any regimen. However,
 assessing
response to treatment often is difficult, and no definitive
 criteria for
cure or failure have been established. Serologic test titers may
 decline
more slowly for patients who previously had syphilis. Patients
 should be
reexamined clinically and serologically at both 6 months and 12
 months;
more frequent evaluation may be prudent if follow-up is uncertain. </p>
<p>Patients who have signs or symptoms that persist or recur or
 who have a
sustained fourfold increase in nontreponemal test titer (i.e., in
comparison with either the baseline titer or a subsequent result)
 probably
failed treatment or were reinfected. These patients should be
 re-treated
after reevaluation for HIV infection. Unless reinfection with T.
 pallidum
is certain, a lumbar puncture also should be performed. </p>
<p>Failure of nontreponemal test titers to decline fourfold within
 6
months after therapy for primary or secondary syphilis identifies
 persons
at risk for treatment failure. Such persons should be reevaluated
 for HIV
infection. Optimal management of such patients is unclear. At a
 minimum,
these patients should have additional clinical and serologic
 follow-up.
HIV-infected patients should be evaluated more frequently (i.e., at
 3-month
intervals instead of 6-month intervals). If additional follow-up
 cannot be
ensured, re-treatment is recommended. Some experts recommend CSF
examination in such situations. </p>
<p>When patients are re-treated, most experts recommend
 re-treatment with
three weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million
 units IM,
unless CSF examination indicates that neurosyphilis is present. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Refer to General Principles, Management of Sex Partners. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy </p>
<p>Nonpregnant penicillin-allergic patients who have primary or
 secondary
syphilis should be treated with one of the following regimens.
 Close
follow-up of such patients is essential. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 2 weeks,
OR
Tetracycline 500 mg orally four times a day for 2 weeks. </p>
<p>There is less clinical experience with doxycycline than with
tetracycline, but compliance is likely to be better with
 doxycycline.
Therapy for a patient who cannot tolerate either doxycycline or
tetracycline should depend on whether the patient's compliance with
 the
therapy regimen and with follow-up examinations can be ensured. </p>
<p>Pharmacologic and bacteriologic considerations suggest that
 ceftriaxone
should be effective, but data concerning ceftriaxone are limited
 and
clinical experience is insufficient to enable identification of
 late
failures. The optimal dose and duration have not been established
 for
ceftriaxone, but a suggested daily regimen of 1 g may be considered
 if
treponemacidal levels in the blood can be maintained for 8-10 days.

Single-dose ceftriaxone therapy is not effective for treating
 syphilis. </p>
<p>For nonpregnant patients whose compliance with therapy and
 follow-up
can be ensured, an alternative regimen is erythromycin 500 mg
 orally four
times a day for 2 weeks. However, erythromycin is less effective
 than the
other recommended regimens. </p>
<p>Patients whose compliance with therapy or follow-up cannot be
 ensured
should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. Skin testing
 for
penicillin allergy may be useful in some circumstances in which the

reagents and expertise to perform the test adequately are available
 (see
Management of Patients Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnant patients who are allergic to penicillin should be
desensitized, if necessary, and treated with penicillin (see
 Management of
Patients Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy and Syphilis
 During
Pregnancy). </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Refer to Syphilis in HIV-Infected Persons. </p>
<p>Latent Syphilis </p>
<p>Latent syphilis is defined as those periods after infection
 with T.
pallidum when patients are seroreactive, but demonstrate no other
 evidence
of disease. Patients who have latent syphilis and who acquired
 syphilis
within the preceding year are classified as having early latent
 syphilis.
Patients can be demonstrated as having early latent syphilis if,
 within the
year preceding the evaluation, they had a) a documented
 seroconversion, b)
unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis, or c) a sex
 partner
who had primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. Almost all
 other
patients have latent syphilis of unknown duration and should be
 managed as
if they had late latent syphilis. Nontreponemal serologic titers
 usually
are higher during early latent syphilis than late latent syphilis.
 However,
early latent syphilis cannot be reliably distinguished from late
 latent
syphilis solely on the basis of nontreponemal titers. Regardless of
 the
level of the nontreponemal titers, patients in whom the illness
 does not
meet the definition of early syphilis should be treated as if they
 have
late latent infection. All sexually active women with reactive
nontreponemal serologic tests should have a pelvic examination
 before
syphilis staging is completed to evaluate for internal mucosal
 lesions. All
patients who have syphilis should be tested for HIV infection. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Treatment of latent syphilis is intended to prevent occurrence
 or
progression of late complications. Although clinical experience
 supports
the effectiveness of penicillin in achieving these goals, limited
 evidence
is available for guidance in choosing specific regimens. There is
 minimal
evidence to support the use of nonpenicillin regimens. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens for Adults </p>
<p>The following regimens are recommended for nonallergic patients
 who
have normal CSF examinations (if performed): </p>
<p>Early Latent Syphilis: </p>
<p>Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a single
 dose.
Late Latent Syphilis or Latent Syphilis of Unknown Duration: </p>
<p>Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total,
 administered as
three doses of 2.4 million units IM each at 1-week
 intervals. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens for Children </p>
<p>After the newborn period, children in whom syphilis is
 diagnosed should
have a CSF examination to exclude neurosyphilis, and birth and
 maternal
medical records should be reviewed to assess whether the child has
congenital or acquired syphilis (see Congenital Syphilis). Older
 children
with acquired latent syphilis should be evaluated as described for
 adults
and treated using the following pediatric regimens (see Sexual
 Assault or
Abuse of Children). These regimens are for non-allergic children
 who have
acquired syphilis and whose results of the CSF examination were
 normal. </p>
<p>Early Latent Syphilis: </p>
<p>Benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg IM, up to the adult
 dose of
2.4 million units in a single dose.
Late Latent Syphilis or Latent Syphilis of Unknown Duration: </p>
<p>Benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg IM, up to the adult
 dose of
2.4 million units, administered as three doses at 1-week
 intervals
(total 150,000 units/kg up to the adult total dose of 7.2
 million
units). </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>All patients who have latent syphilis should be evaluated
 clinically
for evidence of tertiary disease (e.g., aortitis, neurosyphilis,
 gumma, and
iritis). Patients who have syphilis and who demonstrate any of the
following criteria should have a prompt CSF examination: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Neurologic or ophthalmic signs or symptoms; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Evidence of active tertiary syphilis (e.g., aortitis, gumma,
 and
    iritis); </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Treatment failure; and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    HIV infection with late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown
    duration. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If dictated by circumstances and patient preferences, a CSF
 examination
may be performed for patients who do not meet these criteria. If a
 CSF
examination is performed and the results indicate abnormalities
 consistent
with neurosyphilis, the patient should be treated for neurosyphilis
 (see
Neurosyphilis). </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Quantitative nontreponemal serologic tests should be repeated
 at 6, 12,
and 24 months. Limited data are available to guide evaluation of
 the
treatment response for patients who have latent syphilis. Patients
 should
be evaluated for neurosyphilis and re-treated appropriately if a)
 titers
increase fourfold, b) an initially high titer (greater than or
 equal to
1:32) fails to decline at least fourfold (i.e., two dilutions)
 within 12-24
months, or c) signs or symptoms attributable to syphilis develop in
 the
patient. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Refer to General Principles, Management of Sex Partners. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy </p>
<p>Nonpregnant patients who have latent syphilis and who are
 allergic to
penicillin should be treated with one of the following regimens. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day,
OR
Tetracycline 500 mg orally four times a day. </p>
<p>Both drugs should be administered for 2 weeks if the duration of
 infection
is known to have been less than 1 year; otherwise, they should be
administered for 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnant patients who are allergic to penicillin should be
 desensitized
and treated with penicillin (see Management of Patients Who Have a
 History
of Penicillin Allergy and Syphilis During Pregnancy). </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Refer to Syphilis in HIV-Infected Persons. </p>
<p>Tertiary Syphilis </p>
<p>Tertiary syphilis refers to gumma and cardiovascular syphilis,
 but not
to neurosyphilis. Nonallergic patients without evidence of
 neurosyphilis
should be treated with the following regimen. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered
 as three
doses of 2.4 million units IM at 1-week intervals. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Patients who have symptomatic late syphilis should have a CSF
examination before therapy is initiated. Some experts treat all
 patients
who have cardiovascular syphilis with a neurosyphilis regimen. The
 complete
management of patients who have cardiovascular or gummatous
 syphilis is
beyond the scope of these guidelines. These patients should be
 managed in
consultation with an expert. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Information is lacking with regard to follow-up of patients who
 have
late syphilis. The clinical response depends partially on the
 nature of the
lesions. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Refer to General Principles, Management of Sex Partners. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy </p>
<p>Patients allergic to penicillin should be treated according to
 the
recommended regimens for late latent syphilis. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnant patients who are allergic to penicillin should be
desensitized, if necessary, and treated with penicillin (see
 Management of
Patients Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy and Syphilis
 During
Pregnancy). </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Refer to Syphilis in HIV-Infected Persons. </p>
<p>Neurosyphilis </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Central nervous system disease can occur during any stage of
 syphilis.
A patient who has clinical evidence of neurologic involvement with
 syphilis
(e.g., ophthalmic or auditory symptoms, cranial nerve palsies, and
 symptoms
or signs of meningitis) should have a CSF examination. </p>
<p>Syphilitic uveitis or other ocular manifestations frequently
 are
associated with neurosyphilis; patients with these symptoms should
 be
treated according to the recommendations for neurosyphilis. A CSF
examination should be performed for all such patients to identify
 those
with abnormalities who should have follow-up CSF examinations to
 assess
treatment response. </p>
<p>Patients who have neurosyphilis or syphilitic eye disease
 (e.g.,
uveitis, neuroretinitis, or optic neuritis) and who are not
 allergic to
penicillin should be treated with the following regimen: </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18-24 million units a day,
administered as 3-4 million units IV every 4 hours for 10-14
 days. </p>
<p>If compliance with therapy can be ensured, patients may be treated
 with the
following alternative regimen: </p>
<p>Alternative Regimen </p>
<p>Procaine penicillin 2.4 million units IM a day, PLUS Probenecid
 500 mg
orally four times a day, both for 10-14 days. </p>
<p>The durations of the recommended and alternative regimens for
neurosyphilis are shorter than that of the regimen used for late
 syphilis
in the absence of neurosyphilis. Therefore, some experts administer

benzathine penicillin, 2.4 million units IM, after completion of
 these
neurosyphilis treatment regimens to provide a comparable total
 duration of
therapy. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Other considerations in the management of patients who have
neurosyphilis are as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    All patients who have syphilis should be tested for HIV. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Many experts recommend treating patients who have evidence of
 auditory
    disease caused by syphilis in the same manner as for
 neurosyphilis,
    regardless of the findings on CSF examination. Although
 systemic
    steroids are used frequently as adjunctive therapy for otologic

    syphilis, such drugs have not been proven beneficial. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>If CSF pleocytosis was present initially, a CSF examination
 should be
repeated every 6 months until the cell count is normal. Follow-up
 CSF
examinations also can be used to evaluate changes in the VDRL-CSF
 or CSF
protein after therapy; however, changes in these two parameters are
 slower,
and persistent abnormalities are of less importance. If the cell
 count has
not decreased after 6 months, or if the CSF is not entirely normal
 after 2
years, re-treatment should be considered. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Refer to General Principles, Management of Sex Partners. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy </p>
<p>Data have not been collected systematically for evaluation of
therapeutic alternatives to penicillin for treatment of
 neurosyphilis.
Patients who report being allergic to penicillin should either be
densensitized to penicillin or be managed in consultation with an
 expert.
In some situations, skin testing to confirm penicillin allergy may
 be
useful (see Management of Patients Who Have a History of Penicillin

Allergy). </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnant patients who are allergic to penicillin should be
desensitized, if necessary, and treated with penicillin (see
 Syphilis
During Pregnancy). </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Refer to Syphilis in HIV-Infected Persons. </p>
<p>Syphilis in HIV-Infected Persons </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Unusual serologic responses have been observed among
 HIV-infected
persons who have syphilis. Most reports involved serologic titers
 that were
higher than expected, but false-negative serologic test results or
 delayed
appearance of seroreactivity also have been reported. Nevertheless,
 both
treponemal and nontreponemal serologic tests for syphilis can be
interpreted in the usual manner for most patients who are
 coinfected with
T. pallidum and HIV. </p>
<p>When clinical findings suggest that syphilis is present, but
 serologic
tests are nonreactive or unclear, alternative tests (e.g., biopsy
 of a
lesion, darkfield examination, or direct fluorescent antibody
 staining of
lesion material) may be useful. </p>
<p>Neurosyphilis should be considered in the differential
 diagnosis of
neurologic disease in HIV-infected persons. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>In comparison with HIV-negative patients, HIV-infected patients
 who
have early syphilis may be at increased risk for neurologic
 complications
and may have higher rates of treatment failure with currently
 recommended
regimens. The magnitude of these risks, although not defined
 precisely, is
probably minimal. No treatment regimens for syphilis are
 demonstrably more
effective in preventing neurosyphilis in HIV-infected patients than
 the
syphilis regimens recommended for HIV-negative patients. Careful
 follow-up
after therapy is essential. </p>
<p>Primary and Secondary Syphilis in HIV-Infected Persons </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Treatment with benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million units IM,
 as for
HIV-negative patients, is recommended. Some experts recommend
 additional
treatments (e.g., three weekly doses of benzathine penicillin G as
suggested for late syphilis) or other supplemental antibiotics in
 addition
to benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>CSF abnormalities often occur among both asymptomatic
 HIV-infected
patients in the absence of syphilis and HIV-negative patients who
 have
primary or secondary syphilis. Such abnormalities in HIV-infected
 patients
who have primary or secondary syphilis are of unknown prognostic
significance. Most HIV-infected patients respond appropriately to
 the
currently recommended penicillin therapy; however, some experts
 recommend
CSF examination before therapy and modification of treatment
 accordingly. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>It is important that HIV-infected patients be evaluated
 clinically and
serologically for treatment failure at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months
 after
therapy. Although of unproven benefit, some experts recommend a CSF

examination after therapy (i.e., at 6 months). </p>
<p>HIV-infected patients who meet the criteria for treatment
 failure
should be managed the same as HIV-negative patients (i.e., a CSF
examination and re-treatment). CSF examination and re-treatment
 also should
be strongly considered for patients whose nontreponemal test titer
 does not
decrease fourfold within 6-12 months. Most experts would re-treat
 patients
with 7.2 million units of benzathine penicillin G (administered as
 three
weekly doses of 2.4 million units each) if CSF examinations are
 normal. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy </p>
<p>Penicillin-allergic patients who have primary or secondary
 syphilis and
HIV infection should be managed according to the recommendations
 for
penicillin-allergic HIV-negative patients. </p>
<p>Latent Syphilis in HIV-Infected Persons </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>HIV-infected patients who have early latent syphilis should be
 managed
and treated according to the recommendations for HIV-negative
 patients who
have primary and secondary syphilis. </p>
<p>HIV-infected patients who have either late latent syphilis or
 syphilis
of unknown duration should have a CSF examination before treatment.
 </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>A patient with late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown
 duration and
a normal CSF examination can be treated with 7.2 million units of
benzathine penicillin G (as three weekly doses of 2.4 million units
 each).
Patients who have CSF consistent with neurosyphilis should be
 treated and
managed as described for neurosyphilis (see Neurosyphilis). </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients should be evaluated clinically and serologically at 6,
 12, 18,
and 24 months after therapy. If, at any time, clinical symptoms
 develop or
nontreponemal titers rise fourfold, a repeat CSF examination should
 be
performed and treatment administered accordingly. If between 12 and
 24
months the nontreponemal titer fails to decline fourfold, the CSF
examination should be repeated, and treatment administered
 accordingly. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy </p>
<p>Penicillin regimens should be used to treat all stages of
 syphilis in
HIV-infected patients. Skin testing to confirm penicillin allergy
 may be
used (see Management of Patients Who Have a History of Penicillin
 Allergy).
Patients may be desensitized, then treated with penicillin. </p>
<p>Syphilis During Pregnancy </p>
<p>All women should be screened serologically for syphilis during
 the
early stages of pregnancy. In populations in which utilization of
 prenatal
care is not optimal, RPR-card test screening and treatment (i.e.,
 if the
RPR-card test is reactive) should be performed at the time a
 pregnancy is
diagnosed. For communities and populations in which the prevalence
 of
syphilis is high or for patients at high risk, serologic testing
 should be
performed twice during the third trimester, at 28 weeks of
 gestation and at
delivery. (Some states mandate screening at delivery for all
 women.) Any
woman who delivers a stillborn infant after 20 weeks of gestation
 should be
tested for syphilis. No infant should leave the hospital without
 the
maternal serologic status having been determined at least once
 during
pregnancy. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Seropositive pregnant women should be considered infected
 unless an
adequate treatment history is documented clearly in the medical
 records and
sequential serologic antibody titers have declined. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Penicillin is effective for preventing maternal transmission to
 the
fetus and for treating fetal-established infection. Evidence is
insufficient to determine whether the specific, recommended
 penicillin
regimens are optimal. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Treatment during pregnancy should be the penicillin regimen
 appropriate
for the stage of syphilis. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Some experts recommend additional therapy in some settings. A
 second
dose of benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units IM may be
 administered 1
week after the initial dose for women who have primary, secondary,
 or early
latent syphilis. Ultrasonographic signs of fetal syphilis (i.e.,
hepatomegaly and hydrops) indicate a greater risk for fetal
 treatment
failure; such cases should be managed in consultation with
 obstetric
specialists. </p>
<p>Women treated for syphilis during the second half of pregnancy
 are at
risk for premature labor and/or fetal distress if the treatment
precipitates the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. These women should be
 advised
to seek obstetric attention after treatment if they notice any
 contractions
or decrease in fetal movements. Stillbirth is a rare complication
 of
treatment, but concern for this complication should not delay
 necessary
treatment. All patients who have syphilis should be offered testing
 for HIV
infection. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Coordinated prenatal care and treatment follow-up are
 important, and
syphilis case management may help facilitate prenatal enrollment.
 Serologic
titers should be repeated in the third trimester and at delivery.
 Serologic
titers may be checked monthly in women at high risk for reinfection
 or in
geographic areas in which the prevalence of syphilis is high. The
 clinical
and antibody response should be appropriate for the stage of
 disease. Most
women will deliver before their serologic response to treatment can
 be
assessed definitively. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Refer to General Principles, Management of Sex Partners. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy </p>
<p>There are no proven alternatives to penicillin for treatment of

syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women who have a history of
 penicillin
allergy should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. Skin
 testing
may be helpful (see Management of Patients Who Have a History of
 Penicillin
Allergy). </p>
<p>Tetracycline and doxycycline usually are not used during
 pregnancy.
Erythromycin should not be used, because it does not reliably cure
 an
infected fetus. Data are insufficient to recommend azithromycin or
ceftriaxone. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Refer to Syphilis in HIV-Infected Persons. </p>
<br>
<p>CONGENITAL SYPHILIS </p>
<p>Effective prevention and detection of congenital syphilis
 depends on
the identification of syphilis in pregnant women and, therefore, on
 the
routine serologic screening of pregnant women at the time of the
 first
prenatal visit. Serologic testing and a sexual history also should
 be
obtained at 28 weeks of gestation and at delivery in communities
 and
populations in which the risk for congenital syphilis is high.
 Moreover, as
part of the management of pregnant women who have syphilis,
 information
concerning treatment of sex partners should be obtained in order to
 assess
possible maternal reinfection. All pregnant women who have syphilis
 should
be tested for HIV infection. </p>
<p>Routine screening of newborn sera or umbilical cord blood is
 not
recommended. Serologic testing of the mother's serum is preferred
 to
testing infant serum, because the serologic tests performed on
 infant serum
can be nonreactive if the mother's serologic test result is of low
 titer or
if the mother was infected late in pregnancy. No infant should
 leave the
hospital without the maternal serologic status having been
 documented at
least once during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Evaluation and Treatment of Infants During the First Month of Life </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>The diagnosis of congenital syphilis is complicated by the
transplacental transfer of maternal nontreponemal and treponemal
 IgG
antibodies to the fetus. This transfer of antibodies makes the
interpretation of reactive serologic tests for syphilis in infants
difficult. Treatment decisions often must be made based on a)
identification of syphilis in the mother; b) adequacy of maternal
treatment; c) presence of clinical, laboratory, or radiographic
 evidence of
syphilis in the infant; and d) comparison of the infant's
 nontreponemal
serologic test results with those of the mother. </p>
<p>Who Should Be Evaluated </p>
<p>All infants born to seroreactive mothers should be evaluated
 with a
quantitative nontreponemal serologic test (RPR or VDRL) performed
 on infant
serum (i.e., umbilical cord blood might be contaminated with
 maternal blood
and might yield a false-positive result). A treponemal test (i.e.,
 MHA-TP
or FTA-ABS) of a newborn's serum is not necessary. </p>
<p>Evaluation </p>
<p>All infants born to women who have reactive serologic tests for

syphilis should be examined thoroughly for evidence of congenital
 syphilis
(e.g., nonimmune hydrops, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, rhinitis,
 skin
rash, and/or pseudoparalysis of an extremity). Pathologic
 examination of
the placenta or umbilical cord using specific fluorescent
 antitreponemal
antibody staining is suggested. Darkfield microscopic examination
 or direct
fluorescent antibody staining of suspicious lesions or body fluids
 (e.g.,
nasal discharge) also should be performed. </p>
<p>Further evaluation of the infant is dependent on a) whether any

abnormalities are present on physical examination, b) maternal
 treatment
history, c) stage of infection at the time of treatment, and d)
 comparison
of maternal (at delivery) and infant nontreponemal titers utilizing
 the
same test and preferably the same laboratory. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Infants should be treated for presumed congenital syphilis if
 they were
born to mothers who met any of the following criteria: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Had untreated syphilis at delivery; * </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Had serologic evidence of relapse or reinfection after
 treatment (i.e.,
    a fourfold or greater increase in nontreponemal antibody
 titer); </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Was treated with erythromycin or other nonpenicillin regimen
 for
    syphilis during pregnancy; ** </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Was treated for syphilis less than or equal to 1 month before
 delivery; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Did not have a well-documented history of treatment for
 syphilis; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Was treated for early syphilis during pregnancy with the
 appropriate
    penicillin regimen, but nontreponemal antibody titers did not
 decrease
    at least fourfold; or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Was treated appropriately before pregnancy but had insufficient

    serologic follow-up to ensure an adequate treatment response
 and lack
    of current infection (i.e., an appropriate response includes a}
 at
    least a fourfold decrease in nontreponemal antibody titers for
 patients
    treated for early syphilis and b} stable or declining
 nontreponemal
    titers of less than or equal to 1:4 for other patients). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of a maternal history of infection with T. pallidum
 or
treatment for syphilis, the evaluation should include the following
 tests
if the infant has either a) an abnormal physical examination that
 is
consistent with congenital syphilis, b) a serum quantitative
 nontreponemal
serologic titer that is fourfold greater than the mother's titer,
 or c) a
positive darkfield or fluorescent antibody test of body fluid(s). </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Complete blood count (CBC) and differential CBC and platelet
 count; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Other tests as clinically indicated (e.g., long-bone
 radiographs, chest
    radiograph, liver-function tests, cranial ultrasound,
 ophthalmologic
    examination, and auditory brainstem response). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 100,000-150,000 units/kg/day,
administered as 50,000 units/kg/dose IV every 12 hours during
 the first
7 days of life, and every 8 hours thereafter for a total of 10
 days;
OR
Procaine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg/dose IM a day in a single
 dose
for 10 days. </p>
<p>If greater than 1 day of therapy is missed, the entire course
 should be
restarted. Data are insufficient regarding the use of other
 antimicrobial
agents (e.g., ampicillin). When possible, a full 10-day course of
penicillin is preferred. The use of agents other than penicillin
 requires
close serologic follow-up to assess adequacy of therapy. </p>
<p>In all other situations, the maternal history of infection with
 T.
pallidum and treatment for syphilis must be considered when
 evaluating and
treating the infant. For infants who have a normal physical
 examination and
a serum quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer the same or less
 than
fourfold the maternal titer, the evaluation depends on the maternal

treatment history and stage of infection. </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    The infant should receive the following treatment if a) the
 maternal
    treatment was not given, was undocumented, was a nonpenicillin
 regimen,
    or was administered less than or equal to 4 weeks before

</ul>
<p>** The absence of a fourfold greater titer for an infant does not
 exclude
congenital syphilis. </p>
<p>*** CSF test results obtained during the neonatal period can be
 difficult
to interpret; normal values differ by gestational age and are
 higher in
preterm infants. Values as high as 25 white blood cells (WBCs)/mm3
 and/or
protein of 150 mg/dL might occur among normal neonates; some
 experts,
however, recommend that lower values (i.e., 5 WBCs/mm3 and protein
 of 40
mg/dL) be considered the upper limits of normal. Other causes of
 elevated
values also should be considered when an infant is being evaluated
 for
congenital syphilis.
**** If the infant's nontreponemal test is nonreactive and the
 likelihood
of the infant being infected is low, some experts recommend no
 evaluation
but treatment of the infant with a single IM dose of benzathine
 penicillin
G 50,000 units/kg for possible incubating syphilis, after which the
 infant
should have close serologic follow-up. </p>
<p>Evaluation and Treatment of Older Infants and Children Who Have
 Congenital
Syphilis </p>
<p>Children who are identified as having reactive serologic tests
 for
syphilis after the neonatal period (i.e., at greater than 1 month
 of age)
should have maternal serology and records reviewed to assess
 whether the
child has congenital or acquired syphilis (for acquired syphilis,
 see
Primary and Secondary Syphilis and Latent Syphilis). If the child
 possibly
has congenital syphilis, the child should be evaluated fully (i.e.,
 a CSF
examination for cell count, protein, and VDRL {abnormal CSF
 evaluation
includes a reactive VDRL test, greater than 5 WBCs/mm3, and/or
 protein
greater than 40 mg/dL}; an eye examination; and other tests such as

long-bone radiographs, CBC, platelet count, and auditory brainstem
 response
as indicated clinically). Any child who possibly has congenital
 syphilis or
who has neurologic involvement should be treated with aqueous
 crystalline
penicillin G, 200,000-300,000 units/kg/day IV (administered as
 50,000
units/kg every 4-6 hours) for 10 days. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>All seroreactive infants (or an infant whose mother was
 seroreactive at
delivery) should receive careful follow-up examinations and
 serologic
testing (i.e., a nontreponemal test) every 2-3 months until the
 test
becomes nonreactive or the titer has decreased fourfold.
 Nontreponemal
antibody titers should decline by 3 months of age and should be
 nonreactive
by 6 months of age if the infant was not infected (i.e., if the
 reactive
test result was caused by passive transfer of maternal IgG
 antibody) or was
infected but adequately treated. The serologic response after
 therapy may
be slower for infants treated after the neonatal period. If these
 titers
are stable or increasing after 6-12 months of age, the child should
 be
evaluated, including a CSF examination, and treated with a 10-day
 course of
parenteral penicillin G. </p>
<p>Treponemal tests should not be used to evaluate treatment
 response
because the results for an infected child can remain positive
 despite
effective therapy. Passively transferred maternal treponemal
 antibodies
could be present in an infant until age 15 months. A reactive
 treponemal
test after age 18 months is diagnostic of congenital syphilis. If
 the
nontreponemal test is nonreactive at this time, no further
 evaluation or
treatment is necessary. If the nontreponemal test is reactive at
 age 18
months, the infant should be fully (re)evaluated and treated for
 congenital
syphilis. </p>
<p>Infants whose initial CSF evaluation is abnormal should undergo
 a
repeat lumbar puncture approximately every 6 months until the
 results are
normal. A reactive CSF VDRL test or abnormal CSF indices that
 cannot be
attributed to other ongoing illness requires re-treatment for
 possible
neurosyphilis. </p>
<p>Follow-up of children treated for congenital syphilis after the
 newborn
period should be the same as that prescribed for congenital
 syphilis among
neonates. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy </p>
<p>Infants and children who require treatment for syphilis but who
 have a
history of penicillin allergy or develop an allergic reaction
 presumed
secondary to penicillin should be desensitized, if necessary, and
 treated
with penicillin. Skin testing may be helpful in some patients and
 settings
(see Management of Patients Who Have a History of Penicillin
 Allergy). Data
are insufficient regarding the use of other antimicrobial agents
 (e.g.,
ceftriaxone); if a nonpenicillin agent is used, close serologic and
 CSF
follow-up is indicated. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Data are insufficient regarding whether infants who have
 congenital
syphilis and whose mothers are coinfected with HIV require
 different
evaluation, therapy, or follow-up for syphilis than is recommended
 for all
infants. </p>
<br>
<p>MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY </p>
<p>No proven alternatives to penicillin are available for treating

neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis in pregnant women.
Penicillin also is recommended for use, whenever possible, in
 HIV-infected
patients. Of the adult U.S. population, 3%-10% have experienced
 urticaria,
angioedema, or anaphylaxis (i.e., upper airway obstruction,
 bronchospasm,
or hypotension) after penicillin therapy. Readministration of
 penicillin to
these patients can cause severe, immediate reactions. Because
 anaphylactic
reactions to penicillin can be fatal, every effort should be made
 to avoid
administering penicillin to penicillin-allergic patients, unless
 the
anaphylactic sensitivity has been removed by acute desensitization.
 </p>
<p>An estimated 10% of persons who report a history of severe
 allergic
reactions to penicillin are still allergic. With the passage of
 time after
an allergic reaction to penicillin, most persons who have had a
 severe
reaction stop expressing penicillin-specific IgE. These persons can
 be
treated safely with penicillin. The results of many investigations
 indicate
that skin testing with the major and minor determinants can
 reliably
identify persons at high risk for penicillin reactions. Although
 these
reagents are easily generated and have been available in academic
 centers
for greater than 30 years, only benzylpenicilloyl poly-L-lysine
 (Pre-Pen,
the major determinant) and penicillin G are available commercially.
 Experts
estimate that testing with only the major determinant and
 penicillin G
identifies 90%-97% of the currently allergic patients. However,
 because
skin testing without the minor determinants would still miss 3%-10%
 of
allergic patients, and serious or fatal reactions can occur among
 these
minor-determinant-positive patients, experts suggest caution when
 the full
battery of skin-test reagents is not available (<a href="#00002944.htm">Table_1</a>). </p>
<p>Recommendations </p>
<p>If the full battery of skin-test reagents is available,
 including the
major and minor determinants (see Penicillin Allergy Skin Testing),

patients who report a history of penicillin reaction and are
 skin-test
negative can receive conventional penicillin therapy.
 Skin-test-positive
patients should be desensitized. </p>
<p>If the full battery of skin-test reagents, including the minor
determinants, is not available, the patient should be skin tested
 using
benzylpenicilloyl poly-L-lysine (i.e., the major determinant,
 Pre-Pen) and
penicillin G. Patients who have positive test results should be
desensitized. Some experts believe that persons who have negative
 test
results should be regarded as probably allergic and should be
 desensitized.
Others suggest that those with negative skin-test results can be
 test-dosed
gradually with oral penicillin in a monitored setting in which
 treatment
for anaphylactic reaction is possible. </p>
<p>Penicillin Allergy Skin Testing </p>
<p>Patients at high risk for anaphylaxis (i.e., those who have a
 history
of penicillin-related anaphylaxis, asthma, or other diseases that
 would
make anaphylaxis more dangerous or who are being treated with
beta-adrenergic blocking agents) should be tested with 100-fold
 dilutions
of the full-strength skin-test reagents before being tested with
full-strength reagents. In these situations, patients should be
 tested in a
monitored setting in which treatment for an anaphylactic reaction
 is
available. If possible, the patient should not have taken
 antihistamines
recently (e.g., chlorpheniramine maleate or terfenadine during the
preceding 24 hours, diphenhydramine HCl or hydroxyzine during the
 preceding
4 days, or astemizole during the preceding 3 weeks). </p>

** Aged penicillin is not an adequate source of minor determinants.

<p>Desensitization </p>
<p>Patients who have a positive skin test to one of the penicillin

determinants can be desensitized. This is a straightforward,
 relatively
safe procedure that can be done orally or IV. Although the two
 approaches
have not been compared, oral desensitization is regarded as safer
 to use
and easier to perform. Patients should be desensitized in a
 hospital
setting because serious IgE-mediated allergic reactions, although
 unlikely,
can occur. Desensitization usually can be completed in
 approximately 4
hours, after which the first dose of penicillin is given
 (<a href="#00002944.htm">Table_1</a>). STD
programs should have a referral center where patients who have
 positive
skin test results can be desensitized. After desensitization,
 patients must
be maintained on penicillin continuously for the duration of the
 course of
therapy. </p>
<br>
<p>DISEASES CHARACTERIZED BY URETHRITIS AND CERVICITIS </p>
<p>Management of Male Patients Who Have Urethritis </p>
<p>Urethritis, or inflammation of the urethra, is caused by an
 infection
characterized by the discharge of mucopurulent or purulent material
 and by
burning during urination. Asymptomatic infections are common. The
 only
bacterial pathogens of proven clinical importance in men who have
urethritis are N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Testing to
 determine the
specific disease is recommended because both of these infections
 are
reportable to state health departments, and a specific diagnosis
 may
improve compliance and partner notification. If diagnostic tools
 (e.g., a
Gram stain and microscope) are unavailable, patients should be
 treated for
both infections. The extra expense of treating a person who has
nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) for both infections also should
 encourage
the health-care provider to make a specific diagnosis. New nucleic
 acid
amplification tests enable detection of N. gonorrhoeae and C.
 trachomatis
on first-void urine; in some settings, these tests are more
 sensitive than
traditional culture techniques. </p>
<p>Etiology </p>
<p>NGU is diagnosed if Gram-negative intracellular organisms
 cannot be
identified on Gram stains. C. trachomatis is the most frequent
 cause (i.e.,
in 23%-55% of cases); however, the prevalence differs by age group,
 with
lower prevalence among older men. The proportion of NGU cases
 caused by
chlamydia has been declining gradually. Complications of NGU among
 men
infected with C. trachomatis include epididymitis and Reiter's
 syndrome.
Documentation of chlamydia infection is important because partner
 referral
for evaluation and treatment would be indicated. </p>
<p>The etiology of most cases of nonchlamydial NGU is unknown.
 Ureaplasma
urealyticum and possibly Mycoplasma genitalium are implicated in as
 many as
one third of cases. Specific diagnostic tests for these organisms
 are not
indicated. </p>
<p>Trichomonas vaginalis and HSV sometimes cause NGU. Diagnostic
 and
treatment procedures for these organisms are reserved for
 situations in
which NGU is nonresponsive to therapy. </p>
<p>Confirmed Urethritis </p>
<p>Clinicians should document that urethritis is present.
 Urethritis can
be documented by the presence of any of the following signs: </p>
<ol type="a">
    <li><p>
    Mucopurulent or purulent discharge. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Gram stain of urethral secretions demonstrating greater
 than or
    equal to 5 WBCs per oil immersion field. The Gram stain is
 the
    preferred rapid diagnostic test for evaluating urethritis.
 It is
    highly sensitive and specific for documenting both
 urethritis and
    the presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal

    infection is established by documenting the presence of
 WBCs
    containing intracellular Gram-negative diplococci. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine, or
    microscopic examination of first-void urine demonstrating
 greater
    than or equal to 10 WBCs per high power field. </p>
    <p>If none of these criteria is present, then treatment should be </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>deferred, and the patient should be tested for N. gonorrhoeae and
 C.
trachomatis and followed closely in the event of a positive test
 result. If
the results demonstrate infection with either N. gonorrhoeae or C.
trachomatis, the appropriate treatment should be given and sex
 partners
referred for evaluation and treatment. </p>
<p>Empiric treatment of symptoms without documentation of
 urethritis is
recommended only for patients at high risk for infection who are
 unlikely
to return for a follow-up evaluation (e.g., adolescents who have
 multiple
partners). Such patients should be treated for gonorrhea and
 chlamydia.
Partners of patients treated empirically should be referred for
 evaluation
and treatment. </p>
<p>Management of Patients Who Have Nongonococcal Urethritis </p>
<p>Diagnosis </p>
<p>All patients who have urethritis should be evaluated for the
 presence
of gonococcal and chlamydial infection. Testing for chlamydia is
 strongly
recommended because of the increased utility and availability of
 highly
sensitive and specific testing methods and because a specific
 diagnosis
might improve compliance and partner notification. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after
 diagnosis.
Single-dose regimens have the important advantage of improved
 compliance
and of directly observed therapy. If multiple-dose regimens are
 used, the
medication should be provided in the clinic or health-care
 provider's
office. Treatment with the recommended regimen can result in
 alleviation of
symptoms and microbiologic cure of infection. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose,
OR
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimens </p>
<p>Erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day for 7 days
OR
Erythromycin ethylsuccinate 800 mg orally four times a day for
 7 days,
OR
Ofloxacin 300 mg twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>If only erythromycin can be used and a patient cannot tolerate
high-dose erythromycin schedules, one of the following regimens
 can be
used: </p>
<p>Erythromycin base 250 mg orally four times a day for 14 days,
OR
Erythromycin ethylsuccinate 400 mg orally four times a day for
 14 days. </p>
<p>Follow-Up for Patients Who Have Urethritis </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to return for evaluation if
 symptoms
persist or recur after completion of therapy. Symptoms alone,
 without
documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of urethral
 inflammation, are
not a sufficient basis for re-treatment. Patients should be
 instructed to
abstain from sexual intercourse until therapy is completed. </p>
<p>Partner Referral </p>
<p>Patients should refer for evaluation and treatment all sex
 partners
within the preceding 60 days. A specific diagnosis may facilitate
 partner
referral; therefore, testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia is
 encouraged. </p>
<p>Recurrent and Persistent Urethritis </p>
<p>Objective signs of urethritis should be present before
 initiation of
antimicrobial therapy. Effective regimens have not been identified
 for
treating patients who have persistent symptoms or frequent
 recurrences
after treatment. Patients who have persistent or recurrent
 urethritis
should be re-treated with the initial regimen if they did not
 comply with
the treatment regimen or if they were reexposed to an untreated sex

partner. Otherwise, a wet mount examination and culture of an
 intraurethral
swab specimen for T. vaginalis should be performed. Urologic
 examinations
usually do not reveal a specific etiology. If the patient was
 compliant
with the initial regimen and reexposure can be excluded, the
 following
regimen is recommended: </p>
<p>Recommended Treatment for Recurrent/Persistent Urethritis </p>
<p>Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose,
PLUS
Erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day for 7 days,
OR
Erythromycin ethylsuccinate 800 mg orally four times a day for
 7 days. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Gonococcal urethritis, chlamydial urethritis, and nongoncoccal,

nonchlamydial urethritis may facilitate HIV transmission. Patients
 who have
NGU and also are infected with HIV should receive the same
 treatment
regimen as those who are HIV-negative. </p>
<p>Management of Patients Who Have Mucopurulent Cervicitis (MPC) </p>
<p>MPC is characterized by a purulent or mucopurulent endocervical
 exudate
visible in the endocervical canal or in an endocervical swab
 specimen. Some
experts also make the diagnosis on the basis of easily induced
 cervical
bleeding. Although some experts consider an increased number of
polymorphonuclear leukocytes on endocervical Gram stain as being
 useful in
the diagnosis of MPC, this criterion has not been standardized, has
 a low
positive-predictive value (PPV), and is not available in some
 settings. MPC
often is asymptomatic, but some women have an abnormal vaginal
 discharge
and vaginal bleeding (e.g., after sexual intercourse). MPC can be
 caused by
C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; however, in most cases neither
 organism
can be isolated. MPC can persist despite repeated courses of
 antimicrobial
therapy. Because relapse or reinfection with C. trachomatis or N.
gonorrhoeae usually does not apply to persistent cases of MPC,
 other
non-microbiologic determinants (e.g., inflammation in an ectropion)
 could
be involved. </p>
<p>Patients who have MPC should be tested for C. trachomatis and
 for N.
gonorrhoeae by using the most sensitive and specific test for the
population served. However, MPC is not a sensitive predictor of
 infection
with these organisms, because most women who have C. trachomatis or
 N.
gonorrhoeae do not have MPC. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>The results of sensitive tests for C. trachomatis or N.
 gonorrhoeae
(e.g., culture or nucleic acid amplification tests) should
 determine the
need for treatment, unless the likelihood of infection with either
 organism
is high or the patient is unlikely to return for treatment. Empiric

treatment should be considered for a patient who has a suspected
 case of
gonorrhea and/or chlamydia if a) the prevalence of these diseases
 differs
substantially (i.e., greater than 15%) between clinics in the
 geographic
area and b) the patient might be difficult to locate for treatment.
 After
the possibilities of relapse and reinfection have been excluded,
 management
of persistent MPC is unclear. For such cases, additional
 antimicrobial
therapy may be of little benefit. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Follow-up should be as recommended for the infections for which
 the
woman is being treated. If symptoms persist, women should be
 instructed to
return for reevaluation and to abstain from sexual intercourse even
 if they
have completed the prescribed therapy. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Management of sex partners of women treated for MPC should be
appropriate for the identified or suspected STD. Partners should be

notified, examined, and treated for the STD identified or suspected
 in the
index patient. </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to abstain from sexual
 intercourse until
they and their sex partners are cured. Because a microbiologic test
 of cure
usually is not recommended, patients should abstain from sexual
 intercourse
until therapy is completed (i.e., 7 days after a single-dose
 regimen or
after completion of a 7-day regimen). </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Patients who have MPC and also are infected with HIV should
 receive the
same treatment regimen as those who are HIV-negative. </p>
<p>Chlamydial Infection </p>
<p>In the United States, chlamydial genital infection occurs
 frequently
among sexually active adolescents and young adults. Asymptomatic
 infection
is common among both men and women. Screening sexually active
 adolescents
for chlamydial infection should be routine during annual
 examinations, even
if symptoms are not present. Screening women aged 20-24 years also
 is
suggested, particularly for those who have new or multiple sex
 partners and
who do not consistently use barrier contraceptives. </p>
<p>Chlamydial Infection in Adolescents and Adults </p>
<p>Several important sequelae can result from C. trachomatis
 infection in
women; the most serious of these include PID, ectopic pregnancy,
 and
infertility. Some women who have apparently uncomplicated cervical
infection already have subclinical upper reproductive tract
 infection. A
recent investigation of patients in a health maintenance
 organization
demonstrated that screening and treatment of cervical infection can
 reduce
the likelihood of PID. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Treatment of infected patients prevents transmission to sex
 partners;
and, for infected pregnant women, treatment might prevent
 transmission of
C. trachomatis to infants during birth. Treatment of sex partners
 helps to
prevent reinfection of the index patient and infection of other
 partners. </p>
<p>Coinfection with C. trachomatis often occurs among patients who
 have
gonococcal infection; therefore, presumptive treatment of such
 patients for
chlamydia is appropriate (see Gonococcal Infection, Dual Therapy
 for
Gonococcal and Chlamydial Infections). The following recommended
 treatment
regimens and the alternative regimens cure infection and usually
 relieve
symptoms. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose,
OR
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimens </p>
<p>Erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day for 7 days,
OR
Erythromycin ethylsuccinate 800 mg orally four times a day for
 7 days,
OR
Ofloxacin 300 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>The results of clinical trials indicate that azithromycin and
doxycycline are equally efficacious. These investigations were
 conducted
primarily in populations in which follow-up was encouraged and
 adherence to
a 7-day regimen was good. Azithromycin should always be available
 to
health-care providers to treat at least those patients for whom
 compliance
is in question. </p>
<p>In populations with erratic health-care-seeking behavior, poor
compliance with treatment, or minimal follow-up, azithromycin may
 be more
cost-effective because it provides single-dose, directly observed
 therapy.
Doxycycline costs less than azithromycin, and it has been used
 extensively
for a longer period. Erythromycin is less efficacious than either
azithromycin and doxycycline, and gastrointestinal side effects
 frequently
discourage patients from complying with this regimen. Ofloxacin is
 similar
in efficacy to doxycycline and azithromycin, but it is more
 expensive to
use and offers no advantage with regard to the dosage regimen.
 Other
quinolones either are not reliably effective against chlamydial
 infection
or have not been adequately evaluated. </p>
<p>To maximize compliance with recommended therapies, medications
 for
chlamydial infections should be dispensed on site, and the first
 dose
should be directly observed. To minimize further transmission of
 infection,
patients treated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from
 sexual
intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until
 completion of a
7-day regimen. Patients also should be instructed to abstain from
 sexual
intercourse until all of their sex partners are cured to minimize
 the risk
for reinfection. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients do not need to be retested for chlamydia after
 completing
treatment with doxycycline or azithromycin unless symptoms persist
 or
reinfection is suspected, because these therapies are highly
 efficacious. A
test of cure may be considered 3 weeks after completion of
 treatment with
erythromycin. The validity of chlamydial culture testing at less
 than 3
weeks after completion of therapy to identify patients who did not
 respond
to therapy has not been established. False-negative results can
 occur
because of small numbers of chlamydial organisms. In addition,
 nonculture
tests conducted at less than 3 weeks after completion of therapy
 for
patients who were treated successfully could be false-positive
 because of
continued excretion of dead organisms. </p>
<p>Some studies have demonstrated high rates of infection among
 women
retested several months after treatment, presumably because of
 reinfection.
In some populations (e.g., adolescents), rescreening women several
 months
after treatment might be effective for detecting further morbidity.
 </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to refer their sex partners for
evaluation, testing, and treatment. Because exposure intervals have

received limited evaluation, the following recommendations are
 somewhat
arbitrary. Sex partners should be evaluated, tested, and treated if
 they
had sexual contact with the patient during the 60 days preceding
 onset of
symptoms in the patient or diagnosis of chlamydia. Health-care
 providers
should treat the most recent sex partner even if the time of the
 last
sexual contact was greater than 60 days before onset or diagnosis. </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to abstain from sexual
 intercourse until
they and their sex partners have completed treatment. Because a
microbiologic test of cure usually is not recommended, abstinence
 should be
continued until therapy is completed (i.e., 7 days after a
 single-dose
regimen or after completion of a 7-day regimen). Timely treatment
 of sex
partners is essential for decreasing the risk for reinfecting the
 index
patient. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Doxycycline and ofloxacin are contraindicated for pregnant
 women. The
safety and efficacy of azithromycin use in pregnant and lactating
 women
have not been established. Repeat testing, preferably by culture, 3
 weeks
after completion of therapy with the following regimens is
 recommended,
because a) none of these regimens are highly efficacious and b) the

frequent side effects of erythromycin might discourage patient
 compliance
with this regimen. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens for Pregnant Women </p>
<p>Erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day for 7 days,
OR
Amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimens for Pregnant Women </p>
<p>Erythromycin base 250 mg orally four times a day for 14 days,
OR
Erythromycin ethylsuccinate 800 mg orally four times a day for
 7 days,
OR
Erythromycin ethylsuccinate 400 mg orally four times a day for
 14 days,
OR
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose. </p>
<p>Note: Erythromycin estolate is contraindicated during pregnancy
 because of
drug-related hepatotoxicity. Preliminary data indicate that
 azithromycin
may be safe and effective. However, data are insufficient to
 recommend the
routine use of azithromycin in pregnant women. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Patients who have chlamydial infection and also are infected
 with HIV
should receive the same treatment regimen as those who are
 HIV-negative. </p>
<p>Chlamydial Infection in Infants </p>
<p>Prenatal screening of pregnant women can prevent chlamydial
 infection
among neonates. Pregnant women who are less than 25 years of age or
 who
have new or multiple sex partners particularly should be targeted
 for
screening. Periodic prevalence surveys of chlamydial infection can
 be
conducted to confirm the validity of using these recommendations in

specific clinical settings. </p>
<p>C. trachomatis infection of neonates results from perinatal
 exposure to
the mother's infected cervix. The prevalence of C. trachomatis
 infection
among pregnant women usually is greater than 5%, regardless of
race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Neonatal ocular prophylaxis
 with
silver nitrate solution or antibiotic ointments does not prevent
 perinatal
transmission of C. trachomatis from mother to infant. However,
 ocular
prophylaxis with those agents does prevent gonoccocal ophthalmia
 and should
be continued for that reason (see Prevention of Ophthalmia
 Neonatorum). </p>
<p>Initial C. trachomatis perinatal infection involves mucous
 membranes of
the eye, oropharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum. C. trachomatis
 infection
in neonates is most often recognized by conjunctivitis that
 develops 5-12
days after birth. Chlamydia is the most frequent identifiable
 infectious
cause of ophthalmia neonatorum. C. trachomatis also is a common
 cause of
subacute, afebrile pneumonia with onset from 1 to 3 months of age.
Asymptomatic infections also can occur in the oropharynx, genital
 tract,
and rectum of neonates. </p>
<p>Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by C. trachomatis </p>
<p>A chlamydial etiology should be considered for all infants aged
 less
than or equal to 30 days who have conjunctivitis. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Sensitive and specific methods used to diagnose chlamydial
 ophthalmia
in the neonate include both tissue culture and nonculture tests
 (e.g.,
direct fluorescent antibody tests and immunoassays). Giemsa-stained
 smears
are specific for C. trachomatis, but such tests are not sensitive.
Specimens must contain conjunctival cells, not exudate alone.
 Specimens for
culture isolation and nonculture tests should be obtained from the
 everted
eyelid using a dacron-tipped swab or the swab specified by the
manufacturer's test kit. A specific diagnosis of C. trachomatis
 infection
confirms the need for treatment not only for the neonate, but also
 for the
mother and her sex partner(s). Ocular exudate from infants being
 evaluated
for chlamydial conjunctivitis also should be tested for N.
 gonorrhoeae. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Erythromycin 50 mg/kg/day orally divided into four doses daily
 for 10-14 day </p>
<p>Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate for treatment of
 chlamydial
infection and is unnecessary when systemic treatment is
 administered. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>The efficacy of erythromycin treatment is approximately 80%; a
 second
course of therapy may be required. Follow-up of infants to
 determine
resolution is recommended. The possibility of concomitant
 chlamydial
pneumonia should be considered. </p>
<p>Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners </p>
<p>The mothers of infants who have chlamydial infection and the
 sex
partners of these women should be evaluated and treated (see
 Chlamydial
Infection in Adolescents and Adults). </p>
<p>Infant Pneumonia Caused by C. trachomatis </p>
<p>Characteristic signs of chlamydial pneumonia in infants include
 a) a
repetitive staccato cough with tachypnea and b) hyperinflation and
bilateral diffuse infiltrates on a chest radiograph. Wheezing is
 rare, and
infants are typically afebrile. Peripheral eosinophilia sometimes
 occurs in
infants who have chlamydial pneumonia. Because clinical
 presentations
differ, initial treatment and diagnostic tests should encompass C.
trachomatis for all infants aged 1-3 months who possibly have
 pneumonia. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Specimens for chlamydial testing should be collected from the
nasopharynx. Tissue culture is the definitive standard for
 chlamydial
pneumonia; nonculture tests can be used with the knowledge that
 nonculture
tests of nasopharyngeal specimens produce lower sensitivity and
 specificity
than nonculture tests of ocular specimens. Tracheal aspirates and
 lung
biopsy specimens, if collected, should be tested for C.
 trachomatis. </p>
<p>The microimmunofluorescence test for C. trachomatis antibody is
 useful
but not widely available. An acute IgM antibody titer greater than
 or equal
to 1:32 is strongly suggestive of C. trachomatis pneumonia. </p>
<p>Because of the delay in obtaining test results for chlamydia,
 the
decision to include an agent in the antibiotic regimen that is
 active
against C. trachomatis must frequently be based on the clinical and

radiologic findings. The results of tests for chlamydial infection
 assist
in the management of an infant's illness and determine the need for

treating the mother and her sex partner(s). </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Erythromycin base 50 mg/kg/day orally divided into four doses
 daily for
10-14 days. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>The effectiveness of erythromycin treatment is approximately
 80%; a
second course of therapy may be required. Follow-up of infants is
recommended to determine whether the pneumonia has resolved. Some
 infants
with chlamydial pneumonia have had abnormal pulmonary function
 tests later
in childhood. </p>
<p>Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners </p>
<p>Mothers of infants who have chlamydial infection and the sex
 partners
of these women should be evaluated and treated according to the
 recommended
treatment of adults for chlamydial infections (see Chlamydial
 Infection in
Adolescents and Adults). </p>
<p>Infants Born to Mothers Who Have Chlamydial Infection </p>
<p>Infants born to mothers who have untreated chlamydia are at
 high risk
for infection; however, prophylatic antibiotic treatment is not
 indicated,
and the efficacy of such treatment is unknown. Infants should be
 monitored
to ensure appropriate treatment if infection develops. </p>
<p>Chlamydial Infection in Children </p>
<p>Sexual abuse must be considered a cause of chlamydial infection
 in
preadolescent children, although perinatally transmitted C.
 trachomatis
infection of the nasopharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum may
 persist for
greater than 1 year (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).
 Because of
the potential for a criminal investigation and legal proceedings
 for sexual
abuse, a diagnosis of C. trachomatis in a preadolescent child
 requires the
high specificity provided by isolation in cell culture. The
 cultures should
be confirmed by microscopic identification of the characteristic
intracytoplasmic inclusions, preferably by fluorescein-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies specific for C. trachomatis. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Nonculture tests for chlamydia should not be used because of
 the
possibility of false-positive test results. With respiratory tract
specimens, false-positive results can occur because of
 cross-reaction of
test reagents with Chlamydia pneumoniae; with genital and anal
 specimens,
false-positive results occur because of cross-reaction with fecal
 flora. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Children who weigh less than 45 kg: </p>
<p>Erythromycin base 50 mg/kg/day orally divided into four
 doses daily
for 10-14 days. </p>
<p>NOTE: The effectiveness of treatment with erythromycin is
approximately 80%; a second course of therapy may be
 required. </p>
<p>Children who weigh greater than or equal to 45 kg but are less
 than 8
years of age: </p>
<p>Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose. </p>
<p>Children greater than or equal to 8 years of age: </p>
<p>Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose,
OR
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>See Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Follow-up cultures are necessary to ensure that treatment has
 been
effective. </p>
<p>Gonococcal Infection </p>
<p>Gonococcal Infection in Adolescents and Adults </p>
<p>In the United States, an estimated 600,000 new infections with
 N.
gonorrhoeae occur each year. Most infections among men produce
 symptoms
that cause them to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent
 serious
sequelae -- but this may not be soon enough to prevent transmission
 to
others. Many infections among women do not produce recognizable
 symptoms
until complications (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease {PID}) have
occurred. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of PID can result
 in
tubal scarring that leads to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.
 Because
gonococcal infections among women often are asymptomatic, an
 important
component of gonorrhea control in the United States continues to be
 the
screening of women at high risk for STDs. </p>
<p>Dual Therapy for Gonococcal and Chlamydial Infections </p>
<p>Patients infected with N. gonorrhoeae often are coinfected with
 C.
trachomatis; this finding led to the recommendation that patients
 treated
for gonococcal infection also be treated routinely with a regimen
 effective
against uncomplicated genital C. trachomatis infection. Routine
 dual
therapy without testing for chlamydia can be cost-effective for
 populations
in which chlamydial infection accompanies 20%-40% of gonococcal
 infections,
because the cost of therapy for chlamydia (e.g., $0.50-$1.50 for
doxycycline) is less than the cost of testing. Some experts believe
 that
the routine use of dual therapy has resulted in substantial
 decreases in
the prevalence of chlamydial infection. Because most gonococci in
 the
United States are susceptible to doxycycline and azithromycin,
 routine
cotreatment might hinder the development of antimicrobial-resistant
 N.
gonorrhoeae. </p>
<p>Since the introduction of dual therapy, the prevalence of
 chlamydial
infection has decreased in some populations, and simultaneous
 testing for
chlamydial infection has become quicker, more sensitive, and more
 widely
available. In geographic areas in which the rates of coinfection
 are low,
some clinicians might prefer to test for chlamydia rather than
 treat
presumptively. However, presumptive treatment is indicated for
 patients who
may not return for test results. </p>
<p>Quinolone-Resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) </p>
<p>Cases of gonorrhea caused by N. gonorrhoeae resistant to
fluoroquinolones have been reported sporadically from many parts of
 the
world, including North America, and are becoming widespread in
 parts of
Asia. As of February 1997, however, QRNG occurred rarely in the
 United
States: less than 0.05% of 4,639 isolates collected by CDC's
 Gonococcal
Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) during 1996 had minimum
 inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) greater than or equal to 1.0 ug/mL to
 ciprofloxacin.
The GISP sample is collected from 26 cities and includes
 approximately 1.3%
of all reported gonococcal infections among men in the United
 States. As
long as QRNG strains comprise less than 1% of all N. gonorrhoeae
 strains
isolated at each of the 26 cities, the fluoroquinolone regimens can
 be used
with confidence. However, importation of QRNG will probably
 continue, and
the prevalence of QRNG in the United States could increase to the
 point
that fluoroquinolones no longer reliably eradicate gonococcal
 infections. </p>
<p>Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infections of the Cervix, Urethra, and
 Rectum </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Cefixime 400 mg orally in a single dose,
OR
Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM in a single dose,
OR
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally in a single dose,
OR
Ofloxacin 400 mg orally in a single dose,
PLUS
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose,
OR
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>Cefixime has an antimicrobial spectrum similar to that of
 ceftriaxone,
but the 400-mg oral dose does not provide as high nor as sustained
 a
bactericidal level as that provided by the 125-mg dose of
 ceftriaxone. In
published clinical trials, the 400-mg dose cured 97.1% of
 uncomplicated
urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections. The advantage of
 cefixime
is that it can be administered orally. </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone in a single injection of 125 mg provides sustained,
 high
bactericidal levels in the blood. Extensive clinical experience
 indicates
that ceftriaxone is safe and effective for the treatment of
 uncomplicated
gonorrhea at all sites, curing 99.1% of uncomplicated urogenital
 and
anorectal infections in published clinical trials. </p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin is effective against most strains of N.
 gonorrhoeae. At a
dose of 500 mg, ciprofloxacin provides sustained bactericidal
 levels in the
blood; in published clinical trials, it has cured 99.8% of
 uncomplicated
urogenital and anorectal infections. Ciprofloxacin is safe,
 relatively
inexpensive, and can be administered orally. </p>
<p>Ofloxacin also is effective against most strains of N.
 gonorrhoeae, and
it has favorable pharmacokinetics. The 400-mg oral dose has been
 effective
for treatment of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal infections,
 curing
98.4% of infections in published clinical trials. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimens </p>
<p>Spectinomycin 2 g IM in a single dose. Spectinomycin is
 expensive and
must be injected; however, it has been effective in published
 clinical
trials, curing 98.2% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal
gonococcal infections. Spectinomycin is useful for treatment of

patients who cannot tolerate cephalosporins and quinolones. </p>
<p>Single-dose cephalosporin regimens other than ceftriaxone 125
 mg IM and
cefixime 400 mg orally that are safe and highly effective
 against
uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections
 include a)
ceftizoxime 500 mg IM, b) cefotaxime 500 mg IM, c) cefotetan 1
 g IM,
and d) cefoxitin 2 g IM with probenecid 1 g orally. None of
 these
injectable cephalosporins offers any advantage in comparison
 with
ceftriaxone, and clinical experience with these regimens for
 treatment
of uncomplicated gonorrhea is limited. </p>
<p>Single-dose quinolone regimens include enoxacin 400 mg orally,
lomefloxacin 400 mg orally, and norfloxacin 800 mg orally.
 These
regimens appear to be safe and effective for the treatment of
uncomplicated gonorrhea, but data regarding their use are
 limited. None
of the regimens appears to offer any advantage over
 ciprofloxacin at a
dose of 500 mg or ofloxacin at 400 mg. </p>
<p>Many other antimicrobials are active against N. gonorrhoeae;
 however,
these guidelines are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all

effective treatment regimens. Azithromycin 2 g orally is effective
 against
uncomplicated gonococcal infection, but it is expensive and causes
gastrointestinal distress too often to be recommended for treatment
 of
gonorrhea. At an oral dose of 1 g, azithromycin is insufficiently
effective, curing only 93% of patients in published studies. </p>
<p>Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Pharynx </p>
<p>Gonococcal infections of the pharynx are more difficult to
 eradicate
than infections at urogenital and anorectal sites. Few
 antigonococcal
regimens can reliably cure such infections greater than 90% of the
 time. </p>
<p>Although chlamydial coinfection of the pharynx is unusual,
 coinfection
at genital sites sometimes occurs. Therefore, treatment for both
 gonorrhea
and chlamydia is suggested. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM in a single dose,
OR
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally in a single dose,
OR
Ofloxacin 400 mg orally in a single dose,
PLUS
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose,
OR
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients who have uncomplicated gonorrhea and who are treated
 with any
of the recommended regimens need not return for a test of cure.
 Patients
who have symptoms that persist after treatment should be evaluated
 by
culture for N. gonorrhoeae, and any gonococci isolated should be
 tested for
antimicrobial susceptibility. Infections identified after treatment
 with
one of the recommended regimens usually result from reinfection
 rather than
treatment failure, indicating a need for improved patient education
 and
referral of sex partners. Persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or
 proctitis
also may be caused by C. trachomatis and other organisms. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to refer sex partners for
 evaluation and
treatment. All sex partners of patients who have N. gonorrhoeae
 infection
should be evaluated and treated for N. gonorrhoeae and C.
 trachomatis
infections if their last sexual contact with the patient was within
 60 days
before onset of symptoms or diagnosis of infection in the patient.
 If a
patient's last sexual intercourse was greater than 60 days before
 onset of
symptoms or diagnosis, the patient's most recent sex partner should
 be
treated. Patients should be instructed to avoid sexual intercourse
 until
therapy is completed and they and their sex partners no longer have

symptoms. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions </p>
<p>Persons who cannot tolerate cephalosporins or quinolones should
 be
treated with spectinomycin. Because spectinomycin is unreliable
 (i.e., only
52% effective) against pharyngeal infections, patients who have
 suspected
or known pharyngeal infection should have a pharyngeal culture
 evaluated 3-5 day </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnant women should not be treated with quinolones or
 tetracyclines.
Those infected with N. gonorrhoeae should be treated with a
 recommended or
alternate cephalosporin. Women who cannot tolerate a cephalosporin
 should
be administered a single 2-g dose of spectinomycin IM. Either
 erythromycin
or amoxicillin is recommended for treatment of presumptive or
 diagnosed C.
trachomatis infection during pregnancy (see Chlamydial Infection). </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Patients who have gonococcal infection and also are infected
 with HIV
should receive the same treatment regimen as those who are
 HIV-negative. </p>
<p>Gonococcal Conjunctivitis </p>
<p>Only one study of the treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis
 among
adults in North America has been published recently. In that study,
 12 of
12 patients responded favorably to a single 1-g IM injection of
ceftriaxone. The following recommendations reflect the opinions of
 expert
consultants. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 1 g IM in a single dose, and lavage the infected
 eye with
saline solution once. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to refer their sex partners for
evaluation and treatment (see Gonococcal Infection, Management of
 Sex
Partners). </p>
<p>Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI) </p>
<p>DGI results from gonococcal bacteremia. DGI often results in
 petechial
or pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetrical arthralgia,
 tenosynovitis, or
septic arthritis. The infection is complicated occasionally by
perihepatitis, and rarely by endocarditis or meningitis. Strains of
 N.
gonorrhoeae that cause DGI tend to cause minimal genital
 inflammation. In
the United States, these strains have occurred infrequently during
 the past
decade. </p>
<p>No studies of the treatment of DGI among persons in North
 America have
been published recently. The following recommendations reflect the
 opinions
of experts. No treatment failures have been reported. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Hospitalization is recommended for initial therapy, especially
 for
patients who cannot be relied on to comply with treatment, for
 those in
whom the diagnosis is uncertain, and for those who have purulent
 synovial
effusions or other complications. Patients should be examined for
 clinical
evidence of endocarditis and meningitis. Patients treated for DGI
 should be
treated presumptively for concurrent C. trachomatis infection
 unless
appropriate testing excludes this infection. </p>
<p>Recommended Initial Regimen </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV every 24 hours. </p>
<p>Alternative Initial Regimens </p>
<p>Cefotaxime 1 g IV every 8 hours,
OR
Ceftizoxime 1 g IV every 8 hours,
OR
For persons allergic to B-lactam drugs: </p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin 500 mg IV every 12 hours,
OR
Ofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours,
OR
Spectinomycin 2 g IM every 12 hours.
All regimens should be continued for 24-48 hours after
 improvement
begins, at which time therapy may be switched to one of the
 following
regimens to complete a full week of antimicrobial therapy: </p>
<p>Cefixime 400 mg orally twice a day,
OR
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day,
OR
Ofloxacin 400 mg orally twice a day. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Gonococcal infection often is asymptomatic in sex partners of
 patients
who have DGI. As with uncomplicated gonococcal infections, patients
 should
be instructed to refer their sex partners for evaluation and
 treatment (see
Gonococcal Infection, Management of Sex Partners). </p>
<p>Gonococcal Meningitis and Endocarditis </p>
<p>Recommended Initial Regimen </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV every 12 hours. </p>
<p>Therapy for meningitis should be continued for 10-14 days;
 therapy for
endocarditis should be continued for at least 4 weeks. Treatment of

complicated DGI should be undertaken in consultation with an
 expert. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to refer their sex partners for
evaluation and treatment (see Gonococcal Infection, Management of
 Sex
Partners). </p>
<p>Gonococcal Infection in Infants </p>
<p>Gonococcal infection usually results from exposure to infected
 cervical
exudate at birth. It is usually an acute illness that becomes
 manifest 2-5
days after birth. The prevalence of infection among infants depends
 on the
prevalence of infection among pregnant women, on whether pregnant
 women are
screened for gonorrhea, and on whether newborns receive ophthalmia
prophylaxis. </p>
<p>The most serious manifestations of N. gonorrhoeae infection in
 newborns
are ophthalmia neonatorum and sepsis, including arthritis and
 meningitis.
Less serious manifestations include rhinitis, vaginitis,
 urethritis, and
inflammation at sites of fetal monitoring. </p>
<p>Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by N. gonorrhoeae </p>
<p>Although N. gonorrhoeae is a less frequent cause of ophthalmia
neonatorum in the United States than C. trachomatis and nonsexually

transmitted agents, it is especially important because it may
 result in
perforation of the globe of the eye and in blindness. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Infants at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia are those
 who do
not receive ophthalmia prophylaxis and those whose mothers have had
 no
prenatal care or whose mothers have a history of STDs or substance
 abuse.
Gonococcal ophthalmia is strongly suggested when typical
 Gram-negative
diplococci are identified in conjunctival exudate, justifying
 presumptive
treatment for gonorrhea after appropriate cultures for N.
 gonorrhoeae are
obtained. Appropriate chlamydial testing should be done
 simultaneously.
Presumptive treatment for N. gonorrhoeae may be indicated for
 newborns who
are at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia and who have
 conjunctivitis
but do not have gonococci in a Gram-stained smear of conjunctival
 exudate. </p>
<p>In all cases of neonatal conjunctivitis, conjunctival exudate
 should be
cultured for N. gonorrhoeae and tested for antibiotic
 susceptibility before
a definitive diagnosis is made. A definitive diagnosis is important
 because
of the public health and social consequences of a diagnosis of
 gonorrhea.
Nongonococcal causes of neonatal ophthalmia include Moraxella
 catarrhalis
and other Neisseria species that are indistinguishable from N.
 gonorrhoeae
on Gram-stained smear but can be differentiated in the microbiology

laboratory. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 25-50 mg/kg IV or IM in a single dose, not to
 exceed 125
mg. </p>
<p>NOTE: Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate and is
 unnecessary if
systemic treatment is administered. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Simultaneous infection with C. trachomatis should be considered
 when a
patient does not respond satisfactorily to treatment. Both mother
 and
infant should be tested for chlamydial infection at the same time
 that
gonorrhea testing is done (see Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by C.
trachomatis). Ceftriaxone should be administered cautiously to
hyperbilirubinemic infants, especially those born prematurely. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Infants who have gonococcal ophthalmia should be hospitalized
 and
evaluated for signs of disseminated infection (e.g., sepsis,
 arthritis, and
meningitis). One dose of ceftriaxone is adequate therapy for
 gonococcal
conjunctivitis, but many pediatricians prefer to continue
 antibiotics until
cultures are negative at 48-72 hours. The duration of therapy
 should be
decided in consultation with experienced physicians. </p>
<p>Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners </p>
<p>The mothers of infants who have gonococcal infection and the
 mothers'
sex partners should be evaluated and treated according to the
recommendations for treating gonococcal infections in adults (see
Gonococcal Infection in Adolescents and Adults). </p>
<p>Disseminated Gonococcal Infection and Gonococcal Scalp Abscess in
 Newborns </p>
<p>Sepsis, arthritis, meningitis, or any combination of these are
 rare
complications of neonatal gonococcal infection. Localized
 gonococcal
infection of the scalp might result from fetal monitoring through
 scalp
electrodes. Detection of gonococcal infection in neonates who have
 sepsis,
arthritis, meningitis, or scalp abscesses requires cultures of
 blood, CSF,
and joint aspirate on chocolate agar. Specimens obtained from the
conjunctiva, vagina, oropharynx, and rectum that are cultured on
 gonococcal
selective medium are useful for identifying the primary site(s) of
infection, especially if inflammation is present. Positive
 Gram-stained
smears of exudate, CSF, or joint aspirate provide a presumptive
 basis for
initiating treatment for N. gonorrhoeae. Diagnoses based on
 Gram-stained
smears or presumptive identification of cultures should be
 confirmed with
definitive tests on culture isolates. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 25-50 mg/kg/day IV or IM in a single daily dose for
 7 days,
with a duration of 10-14 days if meningitis is documented;
OR
Cefotaxime 25 mg/kg IV or IM every 12 hours for 7 days, with a
 duration
of 10-14 days if meningitis is documented. </p>
<p>Prophylactic Treatment for Infants Whose Mothers Have Gonococcal
 Infection </p>
<p>Infants born to mothers who have untreated gonorrhea are at
 high risk
for infection. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen in the Absence of Signs of Gonococcal Infection
 </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 25-50 mg/kg IV or IM, not to exceed 125 mg, in a
 single
dose. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Mother and infant should be tested for chlamydial infection. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>A follow-up examination is not required. </p>
<p>Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners </p>
<p>The mothers of infants who have gonococcal infection and the
 mothers'
sex partners should be evaluated and treated according to the
recommendations for treatment of gonococcal infections in adults
 (see
Gonococcal Infection). </p>
<p>Gonococcal Infection in Children </p>
<p>After the neonatal period, sexual abuse is the most frequent
 cause of
gonococcal infection in preadolescent children (see Sexual Assault
 or Abuse
of Children). Vaginitis is the most common manifestation of
 gonococcal
infection in preadolescent children. PID following vaginal
 infection is
probably less common than among adults. Among sexually abused
 children,
anorectal and pharyngeal infections with N. gonorrhoeae are common
 and
frequently asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Because of the legal implications of a diagnosis of N.
 gonorrhoeae
infection in a child, only standard culture procedures for the
 isolation of
N. gonorrhoeae should be used for children. Nonculture gonococcal
 tests for
gonococci (e.g., Gram-stained smear, DNA probes, and EIA tests)
 should not
be used alone; none of these tests have been approved by FDA for
 use with
specimens obtained from the oropharynx, rectum, or genital tract of

children. Specimens from the vagina, urethra, pharynx, or rectum
 should be
streaked onto selective media for isolation of N. gonorrhoeae, and
 all
presumptive isolates of N. gonorrhoeae should be identified
 definitively by
at least two tests that involve different principles (e.g.,
 biochemical,
enzyme substrate, or serologic). Isolates should be preserved to
 enable
additional or repeated testing. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens for Children Who Weigh greater than or equal
 to 45 kg </p>
<p>Children who weigh greater than or equal to 45 kg should be
 treated
with one of the regimens recommended for adults (see Gonococcal

Infection). </p>
<p>NOTE: Quinolones are not approved for use in children because of
 concerns
about toxicity based on animal studies. However, investigations of
ciprofloxacin treatment in children who have cystic fibrosis
 demonstrated
no adverse effects. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen for Children Who Weigh less than 45 kg and Who
 Have
Uncomplicated Gonococcal Vulvovaginitis, Cervicitis, Urethritis,
Pharyngitis, or Proctitis </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM in a single dose. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimen </p>
<p>Spectinomycin 40 mg/kg (maximum dose: 2 g) IM in a single dose
 may be
used, but this therapy is unreliable for treatment of
 pharyngeal
infections. Some experts use cefixime to treat gonococcal
 infections in
children because it can be administered orally; however, no
 reports
have been published concerning the safety or effectiveness of
 cefixime
used for this purpose. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen for Children Who Weigh less than 45 kg and Who
 Have
Bacteremia or Arthritis </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg (maximum dose: 1 g) IM or IV in a single
 dose
daily for 7 days. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen for Children Who Weigh greater than or equal to 45
 kg and
Who Have Bacteremia or Arthritis </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg (maximum dose: 2 g) IM or IV in a single
 dose
daily for 10-14 days. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Follow-up cultures are unnecessary if ceftriaxone is used. If
spectinomycin is used to treat pharyngitis, a follow-up culture is
necessary to ensure that treatment was effective. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Only parenteral cephalosporins are recommended for use in
 children.
Ceftriaxone is approved for all gonococcal infections in children;
cefotaxime is approved for gonococcal ophthalmia only. Oral
 cephalosporins
used for treatment of gonococcal infections in children have not
 been
evaluated adequately. </p>
<p>All children who have gonococcal infections should be evaluated
 for
coinfection with syphilis and C. trachomatis. For a discussion of
 concerns
regarding sexual assault, refer to Sexual Assault or Abuse of
 Children. </p>
<p>Ophthalmia Neonatorum Prophylaxis </p>
<p>Instillation of a prophylactic agent into the eyes of all
 newborn
infants is recommended to prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum;
 this
procedure is required by law in most states. All the recommended
prophylactic regimens in this section prevent gonococcal
 ophthalmia.
However, the efficacy of these preparations in preventing
 chlamydial
ophthalmia is less clear, and they do not eliminate nasopharyngeal
colonization by C. trachomatis. The diagnosis and treatment of
 gonococcal
and chlamydial infections in pregnant women is the best method for
preventing neonatal gonococcal and chlamydial disease. Not all
 women,
however, receive prenatal care; and ocular prophylaxis is warranted
 because
it can prevent sight-threatening gonococcal ophthalmia and it is
 safe, easy
to administer, and inexpensive. </p>
<p>Prophylaxis </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Silver nitrate (1%) aqueous solution in a single application,
OR
Erythromycin (0.5%) ophthalmic ointment in a single
 application,
OR
Tetracycline ophthalmic ointment (1%) in a single application. </p>
<p>One of these recommended preparations should be instilled into
 both
eyes of every neonate as soon as possible after delivery. If
 prophylaxis is
delayed (i.e., not administered in the delivery room), a monitoring
 system
should be established to ensure that all infants receive
 prophylaxis. All
infants should be administered ocular prophylaxis, regardless of
 whether
delivery is vaginal or cesarian. Single-use tubes or ampules are
 preferable
to multiple-use tubes. Bacitracin is not effective. Povidone iodine
 has not
been studied adequately. </p>
<br>
<p>DISEASES CHARACTERIZED BY VAGINAL DISCHARGE </p>
<p>Management of Patients Who Have Vaginal Infections </p>
<p>Vaginitis is usually characterized by a vaginal discharge or
 vulvar
itching and irritation; a vaginal odor may be present. The three
 diseases
most frequently associated with vaginal discharge are
 trichomoniasis
(caused by T. vaginalis), BV (caused by a replacement of the normal
 vaginal
flora by an overgrowth of anaerobic microorganisms and Gardnerella
vaginalis), and candidiasis (usually caused by Candida albicans).
 MPC
caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae can sometimes cause
 vaginal
discharge. Although vulvovaginal candidiasis usually is not
 transmitted
sexually, it is included in this section because it is often
 diagnosed in
women being evaluated for STDs. </p>
<p>Vaginitis is diagnosed by pH and microscopic examination of
 fresh
samples of the discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be
determined by narrow-range pH paper for the elevated pH typical of
 BV or
trichomoniasis (i.e., a pH of greater than 4.5). One way to examine
 the
discharge is to dilute a sample in one to two drops of 0.9% normal
 saline
solution on one slide and 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution on
 a
second slide. An amine odor detected immediately after applying KOH

suggests BV. A cover slip is placed on each slide, and they are
 examined
under a microscope at low- and high-dry power. The motile T.
 vaginalis or
the clue cells of BV usually are identified easily in the saline
 specimen.
The yeast or pseudohyphae of Candida species are more easily
 identified in
the KOH specimen. The presence of objective signs of vulvar
 inflammation in
the absence of vaginal pathogens, along with a minimal amount of
 discharge,
suggests the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or
 other
noninfectious irritation of the vulva. Culture for T. vaginalis is
 more
sensitive than microscopic examination. Laboratory testing fails to

identify the cause of vaginitis among a substantial minority of
 women. </p>
<p>Bacterial Vaginosis </p>
<p>BV is a clinical syndrome resulting from replacement of the
 normal
H2O2-producing Lactobacillus sp. in the vagina with high
 concentrations of
anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Prevotella sp. and Mobiluncus sp.), G.
 vaginalis,
and Mycoplasma hominis. BV is the most prevalent cause of vaginal
 discharge
or malodor; however, half of the women whose illnesses meet the
 clinical
criteria for BV are asymptomatic. The cause of the microbial
 alteration is
not fully understood. Although BV is associated with having
 multiple sex
partners, it is unclear whether BV results from acquisition of a
 sexually
transmitted pathogen. Women who have never been sexually active are
 rarely
affected. Treatment of the male sex partner has not been beneficial
 in
preventing the recurrence of BV. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>BV can be diagnosed by the use of clinical or Gram stain
 criteria.
Clinical criteria require three of the following symptoms or signs:
 </p>
<ol type="a">
    <li><p>
    A homogeneous, white, noninflammatory discharge that
 smoothly coats
    the vaginal walls; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The presence of clue cells on microscopic examination; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A pH of vaginal fluid greater than 4.5; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition
 of 10%
    KOH (i.e., the whiff test). </p>
    <p>When a Gram stain is used, determining the relative
 concentration of </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>the bacterial morphotypes characteristic of the altered flora of BV
 is an
acceptable laboratory method for diagnosing BV. Culture of G.
 vaginalis is
not recommended as a diagnostic tool because it is not specific. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>The principal goal of therapy for BV is to relieve vaginal
 symptoms and
signs of infection. All women who have symptomatic disease require
treatment, regardless of pregnancy status. </p>
<p>BV during pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy
 outcomes. The
results of several investigations indicate that treatment of
 pregnant women
who have BV and who are at high risk for preterm delivery (i.e.,
 those who
previously delivered a premature infant) might reduce the risk for
prematurity. Therefore, high-risk pregnant women who do not have
 symptoms
of BV may be evaluated for treatment. </p>
<p>Although some experts recommend treatment for high-risk
 pregnant women
who have asymptomatic BV, others believe more information is needed
 before
such a recommendation is made. A large, randomized clinical trial
 is
underway to assess treatment for asymptomatic BV in pregnant women;
 the
results of this investigation should clarify the benefits of
 therapy for BV
in women at both low and high risk for preterm delivery. </p>
<p>The bacterial flora that characterizes BV has been recovered
 from the
endometria and salpinges of women who have PID. BV has been
 associated with
endometritis, PID, and vaginal cuff cellulitis after invasive
 procedures
such as endometrial biopsy, hysterectomy, hysterosalpingography,
 placement
of an intrauterine device, cesarean section, and uterine curettage.
 The
results of one randomized controlled trial indicated that treatment
 of BV
with metronidazole substantially reduced postabortion PID. On the
 basis of
these data, consideration should be given to treatment of women who
 have
symptomatic or asymptomatic BV before surgical abortion procedures
 are
performed. However, more information is needed before recommending
 whether
patients who have asymptomatic BV should be treated before other
 invasive
procedures are performed. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens for Nonpregnant Women </p>
<p>For treatment of pregnant women, see Bacterial Vaginosis,
 Special
Considerations, Pregnancy. </p>
<p>Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 7 days,
OR
Clindamycin cream 2%, one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally
 at
bedtime for 7 days,
OR
Metronidazole gel 0.75%, one full applicator (5 g)
 intravaginally twice
a day for 5 days. </p>
<p>NOTE: Patients should be advised to avoid consuming alcohol during
treatment with metronidazole and for 24 hours thereafter.
 Clindamycin cream
is oil-based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Refer
 to condom
product labeling for additional information. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimens </p>
<p>Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose,
OR
Clindamycin 300 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>Metronidazole 2-g single-dose therapy is an alternative regimen
 because
of its lower efficacy for BV. Oral metronidazole (500 mg twice a
 day) is
efficacious for the treatment of BV, resulting in relief of
 symptoms and
improvement in clinical course and flora disturbances. Based on
 efficacy
data from four randomized controlled trials, overall cure rates 4
 weeks
after completion of treatment did not differ significantly between
 the
7-day regimen of oral metronidazole and the clindamycin vaginal
 cream (78%
vs. 82%, respectively). Similarly, the results of another
 randomized
controlled trial indicated that cure rates 7-10 days after
 completion of
treatment did not differ significantly between the 7-day regimen of
 oral
metronidazole and the metronidazole vaginal gel (84% vs. 75%,
respectively). FDA has approved Flagyl ER (TM) (750 mg) once daily
 for 7
days for treatment of BV. However, data concerning clinical
 equivalency
with other regimens have not been published. </p>
<p>Some health-care providers remain concerned about the possible
teratogenicity of metronidazole, which has been suggested by
 experiments
using extremely high and prolonged doses in animals. However, a
 recent
meta-analysis does not indicate teratogenicity in humans. Some
 health-care
providers prefer the intravaginal route because of a lack of
 systemic side
effects (e.g., mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal disturbance and
 unpleasant
taste). Mean peak serum concentrations of metronidazole after
 intravaginal
administration are less than 2% the levels of standard 500-mg oral
 doses,
and the mean bioavailability of clindamycin cream is approximately
 4%. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Follow-up visits are unnecessary if symptoms resolve.
 Recurrence of BV
is not unusual. Because treatment of BV in high-risk pregnant women
 who are
asymptomatic might prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, a follow-up
evaluation, at 1 month after completion of treatment, should be
 considered
to evaluate whether therapy was successful. The alternative BV
 treatment
regimens may be used to treat recurrent disease. No long-term
 maintenance
regimen with any therapeutic agent is recommended. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>The results of clinical trials indicate that a woman's response
 to
therapy and the likelihood of relapse or recurrence are not
 affected by
treatment of her sex partner(s). Therefore, routine treatment of
 sex
partners is not recommended. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Allergy or Intolerance to the Recommended Therapy </p>
<p>Clindamycin cream is preferred in case of allergy or
 intolerance to
metronidazole. Metronidazole gel can be considered for patients who
 do not
tolerate systemic metronidazole, but patients allergic to oral
metronidazole should not be administered metronidazole vaginally. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>BV has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g.,
 premature
rupture of the membranes, preterm labor, and preterm birth), and
 the
organisms found in increased concentration in BV also are
 frequently
present in postpartum or postcesarean endometritis. Because
 treatment of BV
in high-risk pregnant women (i.e., those who have previously
 delivered a
premature infant) who are asymptomatic might reduce preterm
 delivery, such
women may be screened, and those with BV can be treated. The
 screening and
treatment should be conducted at the earliest part of the second
 trimester
of pregnancy. The recommended regimen is metronidazole 250 mg
 orally three
times a day for 7 days. The alternative regimens are a)
 metronidazole 2 g
orally in a single dose or b) clindamycin 300 mg orally twice a day
 for 7
days. </p>
<p>Low-risk pregnant women (i.e., women who previously have not
 had a
premature delivery) who have symptomatic BV should be treated to
 relieve
symptoms. The recommended regimen is metronidazole 250 mg orally
 three
times a day for 7 days. The alternative regimens are a)
 metronidazole 2 g
orally in a single dose; b) clindamycin 300 mg orally twice a day
 for 7
days; or c) metronidazole gel, 0.75%, one full applicator (5 g)
intravaginally, twice a day for 5 days. Some experts prefer the use
 of
systemic therapy for low-risk pregnant women to treat possible
 subclinical
upper genital tract infections. </p>
<p>Lower doses of medication are recommended for pregnant women to

minimize exposure to the fetus. Data are limited concerning the use
 of
metronidazole vaginal gel during pregnancy. The use of clindamycin
 vaginal
cream during pregnancy is not recommended, because two randomized
 trials
indicated an increase in the number of preterm deliveries among
 pregnant
women who were treated with this medication. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Patients who have BV and also are infected with HIV should
 receive the
same treatment regimen as those who are HIV-negative. </p>
<p>Trichomoniasis </p>
<p>Trichomoniasis is caused by the protozoan T. vaginalis. Most
 men who
are infected with T. vaginalis do not have symptoms of infection,
 although
a minority of men have NGU. Many women do have symptoms of
 infection. Of
these women, T. vaginalis characteristically causes a diffuse,
 malodorous,
yellow-green discharge with vulvar irritation; many women have
 fewer
symptoms. Vaginal trichomoniasis might be associated with adverse
 pregnancy
outcomes, particularly premature rupture of the membranes and
 preterm
delivery. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimen * </p>
<p>Metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>Metronidazole is the only oral medication available in the
 United
States for the treatment of trichomoniasis. In randomized clinical
 trials,
the recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates
 of
approximately 90%-95%; ensuring treatment of sex partners might
 increase
the cure rate. Treatment of patients and sex partners results in
 relief of
symptoms, microbiologic cure, and reduction of transmission.
 Metronidazole
gel is approved for treatment of BV, but, like other topically
 applied
antimicrobials that are unlikely to achieve therapeutic levels in
 the
urethra or perivaginal glands, it is considerably less efficacious
 for
treatment of trichomoniasis than oral preparations of metronidazole
 and is
not recommended for use. Several other topically applied
 antimicrobials
have been used for treatment of trichomoniasis, but it is unlikely
 that
these preparations will have greater efficacy than metronidazole
 gel.
-------------------- </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    FDA has approved Flagyl 375 (TM) mg twice a day for 7 days for
 treatment
    of trichomoniasis on the basis of pharmacokinetic equivalency of
 this
    regimen with metronidazole 250 mg three times a day for 7 days. No
 clinical
    data are available, however, to demonstrate clinical equivalency of
 the two
    regimens. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Follow-up is unnecessary for men and women who become
 asymptomatic
after treatment or who are initially asymptomatic. Infections with
 strains
of T. vaginalis that have diminished susceptibility to
 metronidazole can
occur; however, most of these organisms respond to higher doses of
metronidazole. If treatment failure occurs with either regimen, the
 patient
should be re-treated with metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for 7
 days. If
treatment failure occurs repeatedly, the patient should be treated
 with a
single 2-g dose of metronidazole once a day for 3-5 days. </p>
<p>Patients with culture-documented infection who do not respond
 to the
regimens described in this report and in whom reinfection has been
 excluded
should be managed in consultation with an expert; consultation is
 available
from CDC. Evaluation of such cases should include determination of
 the
susceptibility of T. vaginalis to metronidazole. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Sex partners should be treated. Patients should be instructed
 to avoid
sex until they and their sex partners are cured. In the absence of
 a
microbiologic test of cure, this means when therapy has been
 completed and
patient and partner(s) are asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions </p>
<p>Effective alternatives to therapy with metronidazole are not
 available.
Patients who are allergic to metronidazole can be managed by
desensitization (26). </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Patients can be treated with 2 g of metronidazole in a single
 dose. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Patients who have trichomoniasis and also are infected with HIV
 should
receive the same treatment regimen as those who are HIV-negative. </p>
<p>Vulvovaginal Candidiasis </p>
<p>Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is caused by C. albicans or,
occasionally, by other Candida sp., Torulopsis sp., or other
 yeasts. An
estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and
 40%-45%
will have two or more episodes. A small percentage of women (i.e.,
 probably
less than 5%) experience recurrent VVC (RVVC). Typical symptoms of
 VVC
include pruritus and vaginal discharge. Other symptoms may include
 vaginal
soreness, vulvar burning, dyspareunia, and external dysuria. None
 of these
symptoms is specific for VVC. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is suggested clinically by
 pruritus
and erythema in the vulvovaginal area; a white discharge may occur.
 The
diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of
 vaginitis,
and when either a) a wet preparation or Gram stain of vaginal
 discharge
demonstrates yeasts or pseudohyphae or b) a culture or other test
 yields a
positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is
 associated with a
normal vaginal pH (less than or equal to 4.5). Use of 10% KOH in
 wet
preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by
 disrupting
cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae.
 Identifying
Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms should not lead to
 treatment,
because approximately 10%-20% of women usually harbor Candida sp.
 and other
yeasts in the vagina. VVC can occur concomitantly with STDs or
 frequently
following antibacterial vaginal or systemic therapy. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Topical formulations effectively treat VVC. The topically
 applied azole
drugs are more effective than nystatin. Treatment with azoles
 results in
relief of symptoms and negative cultures among 80%-90% of patients
 who
complete therapy. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Intravaginal agents: </p>
<p>Butoconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally for 3 days, * **
OR
Clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally for 7-14 days, *
 **
OR
Clotrimazole 100 mg vaginal tablet for 7 days, *
OR
Clotrimazole 100 mg vaginal tablet, two tablets for 3 days,
 *
OR
Clotrimazole 500 mg vaginal tablet, one tablet in a single
application, *
OR
Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally for 7 days, * **
OR
Miconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository, one suppository for
 3
days, * **
OR
Miconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository, one suppository for
 7        days
OR
Nystatin 100,000-unit vaginal tablet, one tablet for 14
 days,
OR
Tioconazole 6.5% ointment 5 g intravaginally in a single
        applicat
OR
Terconazole 0.4% cream 5 g intravaginally for 7 days, *
OR
Terconazole 0.8% cream 5 g intravaginally for 3 days, *
OR
Terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository, one suppository for
 3 days.*
Oral agent: </p>
<p>Fluconazole 150 mg oral tablet, one tablet in single dose. </p>
<p>Preparations for intravaginal administration of butaconazole,
clotrimazole, miconazole, and tioconazole are available OTC, and
 women with
VVC can choose one of those preparations. The duration for
 treatment with
these preparations may be 1, 3, or 7 days. Self-medication with OTC

preparations should be advised only for women who have been
 diagnosed
previously with VVC and who have a recurrence of the same symptoms.
 Any
woman whose symptoms persist after using an OTC preparation or who
 has a
recurrence of symptoms within 2 months should seek medical care. </p>
<p>A new classification of VVC may facilitate antifungal selection
 as well
as duration of therapy. Uncomplicated VVC (i.e., mild-to-moderate,
sporadic, nonrecurrent disease in a normal host with normally
 susceptible
C. albicans) responds to all the aforementioned azoles, even those
 that are
short-term (less than 7 days) and single-dose therapies. In
 contrast,
complicated VVC (i.e., severe local or recurrent VVC in an abnormal
 host
{e.g., VVC in a patient who has uncontrolled diabetes, or infection
 caused
by a less susceptible fungal pathogen such as Candida glabrata})
 requires a
longer duration of therapy (i.e, 10-14 days) with either topical or
 oral
azoles. Additional studies confirming this approach are in
 progress.

** Over-the-counter (OTC) preparations. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimens </p>
<p>Several trials have demonstrated that oral azole agents (e.g.,
ketoconazole and itraconazole) might be as effective as topical
 agents. The
ease of administering oral agents is an advantage over topical
 therapies.
However, the potential for toxicity associated with using a
 systemic drug,
particularly ketoconazole, must be considered. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to return for follow-up visits
 only if
symptoms persist or recur. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>VVC usually is not acquired through sexual intercourse;
 treatment of
sex partners is not recommended but may be considered for women who
 have
recurrent infection. A minority of male sex partners may have
 balanitis,
which is characterized by erythematous areas on the glans in
 conjunction
with pruritus or irritation. These sex partners might benefit from
treatment with topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Allergy or Intolerance to the Recommended Therapy </p>
<p>Topical agents usually are free of systemic side effects,
 although
local burning or irritation may occur. Oral agents occasionally
 cause
nausea, abdominal pain, and headaches. Therapy with the oral azoles
 has
been associated rarely with abnormal elevations of liver enzymes.
Hepatotoxicity secondary to ketoconazole therapy occurs in an
 estimated one
of every 10,000-15,000 exposed persons. Clinically important
 interactions
might occur when these oral agents are administered with other
 drugs,
including astemizole, calcium channel antagonists, cisapride,
 coumadin,
cyclosporin A, oral hypoglycemic agents, phenytoin, protease
 inhibitors,
tacrolimus, terfenadine, theophylline, trimetrexate, and rifampin. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>VVC often occurs during pregnancy. Only topical azole therapies
 should
be used to treat pregnant women. Of those treatments that have been

investigated for use during pregnancy, the most effective are
 butoconazole,
clotrimazole, miconazole, and terconazole. Many experts recommend 7
 days of
therapy during pregnancy. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Prospective controlled studies are in progress to confirm an
 alleged
increase in incidence of VVC in HIV-infected women. No confirmed
 evidence
has indicated a differential response to conventional antifungal
 therapy
among HIV-positive women who have VVC. As such, women who have
 acute VVC
and also are infected with HIV should receive the same treatment
 regimens
as those who are HIV-negative. </p>
<p>Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis </p>
<p>RVVC, which usually is defined as four or more episodes of
 symptomatic
VVC annually, affects a small percentage of women (i.e., probably
 less than
5%). The pathogenesis of RVVC is poorly understood. Risk factors
 for RVVC
include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and
corticosteroid use. In some women who have RVVC, episodes occur
 after
repeated courses of topical or systemic antibacterials. However,
 this
association is not apparent in the majority of women. Most women
 who have
RVVC have no apparent predisposing conditions. Clinical trials
 addressing
the management of RVVC have involved continuing therapy between
 episodes. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>The optimal treatment for RVVC has not been established;
 however, an
initial intensive regimen continued for approximately 10-14 days,
 followed
immediately by a maintenance regimen for at least 6 months, is
 recommended.
Maintenance ketoconazole 100 mg orally, once a day for less than or
 equal
to 6 months, reduces the frequency of RVVC episodes. Investigations
 are
evaluating a weekly fluconazole regimen, the results of which will
 be
compared with once-monthly oral and topical antimycotic regimens
 that have
only moderate protective efficacy. All cases of RVVC should be
 confirmed by
culture before maintenance therapy is initiated. </p>
<p>Although patients with RVVC should be evaluated for
 predisposing
conditions, routinely performing HIV testing for women with RVVC
 who do not
have HIV risk factors is unnecessary. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients who are receiving treatment for RVVC should receive
 regular
follow-up evaluations to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and
 the
occurrence of side effects. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Treatment of sex partners may be considered for partners who
 have
symptomatic balanitis or penile dermatitis. However, routine
 treatment of
sex partners usually is unnecessary. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Information is insufficient to determine the optimal management
 of RVVC
among HIV-infected women. Until such information becomes available,

management should be the same as for HIV-negative women who have
 RVVC. </p>
<br>
<p>PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE (PID) </p>
<p>PID comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper
 female
genital tract, including any combination of endometritis,
 salpingitis,
tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis. Sexually transmitted
organisms, especially N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, are
 implicated in
most cases; however, microorganisms that can be part of the vaginal
 flora
(e.g., anaerobes, G. vaginalis, H. influenzae, enteric
 Gram-negative rods,
and Streptococcus agalactiae) also can cause PID. In addition, M.
 hominis
and U. urealyticum might be etiologic agents of PID. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Acute PID is difficult to diagnose because of the wide
 variation in the
symptoms and signs. Many women with PID have subtle or mild
 symptoms that
do not readily indicate PID. Consequently, delay in diagnosis and
 effective
treatment probably contributes to inflammatory sequelae in the
 upper
reproductive tract. Laparoscopy can be used to obtain a more
 accurate
diagnosis of salpingitis and a more complete bacteriologic
 diagnosis.
However, this diagnostic tool often is not readily available for
 acute
cases, and its use is not easy to justify when symptoms are mild or
 vague.
Moreover, laparoscopy will not detect endometritis and may not
 detect
subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes. Consequently, a
 diagnosis of
PID usually is based on clinical findings.
The clinical diagnosis of acute PID also is imprecise. Data
 indicate that a
clinical diagnosis of symptomatic PID has a PPV for salpingitis of
 65%-90%
in comparison with laparoscopy. The PPV of a clinical diagnosis of
 acute
PID differs depending on epidemiologic characteristics and the
 clinical
setting, with higher PPV among sexually active young (especially
 teenaged)
women and among patients attending STD clinics or from settings in
 which
rates of gonorrhea or chlamydia are high. In all settings, however,
 no
single historical, physical, or laboratory finding is both
 sensitive and
specific for the diagnosis of acute PID (i.e., can be used both to
 detect
all cases of PID and to exclude all women without PID).
 Combinations of
diagnostic findings that improve either sensitivity (i.e., detect
 more
women who have PID) or specificity (i.e., exclude more women who do
 not
have PID) do so only at the expense of the other. For example,
 requiring
two or more findings excludes more women who do not have PID but
 also
reduces the number of women with PID who are identified. </p>
<p>Many episodes of PID go unrecognized. Although some cases are
asymptomatic, others are undiagnosed because the patient or the
 health-care
provider fails to recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific

symptoms or signs (e.g., abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, or vaginal

discharge {atypical PID}). Because of the difficulty of diagnosis
 and the
potential for damage to the reproductive health of women even by
 apparently
mild or atypical PID, health-care providers should maintain a low
 threshold
for the diagnosis of PID. Even so, the long-term outcome of early
 treatment
of women with asymptomatic or atypical PID is unknown. The
 following
recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to help health-care

providers recognize when PID should be suspected and when they need
 to
obtain additional information to increase diagnostic certainty.
 These
recommendations are based partially on the fact that diagnosis and
management of other common causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g.,
 ectopic
pregnancy, acute appendicitis, and functional pain) are unlikely to
 be
impaired by initiating empiric antimicrobial therapy for PID. </p>
<p>Empiric treatment of PID should be initiated in sexually active
 young
women and others at risk for STDs if all the following minimum
 criteria are
present and no other cause(s) for the illness can be identified: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Lower abdominal tenderness, </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Adnexal tenderness, and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Cervical motion tenderness. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>More elaborate diagnostic evaluation often is needed, because
 incorrect
diagnosis and management might cause unnecessary morbidity. These
additional criteria may be used to enhance the specificity of the
 minimum
criteria listed previously. Additional criteria that support a
 diagnosis of
PID include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Oral temperature greater than 101 F (greater than 38.3 C), </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Abnormal cervical or vaginal discharge, </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Elevated C-reactive protein, and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Laboratory documentation of cervical infection with N.
 gonorrhoeae or
    C. trachomatis. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The definitive criteria for diagnosing PID, which are warranted
 in
selected cases, include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Histopathologic evidence of endometritis on endometrial biopsy,
 </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Transvaginal sonography or other imaging techniques showing
 thickened
    fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or
 tubo-ovarian
    complex, and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Laparoscopic abnormalities consistent with PID. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Although treatment can be initiated before bacteriologic
 diagnosis of
C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae infection, such a diagnosis
 emphasizes the
need to treat sex partners. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>PID treatment regimens must provide empiric, broad-spectrum
 coverage of
likely pathogens. Antimicrobial coverage should include N.
 gonorrhoeae, C.
trachomatis, anaerobes, Gram-negative facultative bacteria, and
streptococci. Although several antimicrobial regimens have been
 effective
in achieving a clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized
 clinical
trials with short-term follow-up, few investigations have a)
 assessed and
compared these regimens with regard to elimination of infection in
 the
endometrium and fallopian tubes or b) determined the incidence of
 long-term
complications (e.g., tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy). </p>
<p>All regimens should be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C.
trachomatis, because negative endocervical screening does not
 preclude
upper-reproductive tract infection. Although the need to eradicate
anaerobes from women who have PID has not been determined
 definitively, the
evidence suggests that this may be important. Anaerobic bacteria
 have been
isolated from the upper-reproductive tract of women who have PID,
 and data
from in vitro studies have revealed that anaerobes such as
 Bacteroides
fragilis can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. In addition,
 BV also
is diagnosed in many women who have PID. Until treatment regimens
 that do
not adequately cover these microbes have been shown to prevent
 sequelae as
well as the regimens that are effective against these microbes, the

recommended regimens should have anaerobic coverage. Treatment
 should be
initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made,
 because
prevention of long-term sequelae has been linked directly with
 immediate
administration of appropriate antibiotics. When selecting a
 treatment
regimen, health-care providers should consider availability, cost,
 patient
acceptance, and antimicrobial susceptibility. </p>
<p>In the past, many experts recommended that all patients who had
 PID be
hospitalized so that bed rest and supervised treatment with
 parenteral
antibiotics could be initiated. However, hospitalization is no
 longer
synonymous with parenteral therapy. No currently available data
 compare the
efficacy of parenteral with oral therapy or inpatient with
 outpatient
treatment settings. Until the results from ongoing trials comparing

parenteral inpatient therapy with oral outpatient therapy for women
 who
have mild PID are available, such decisions must be based on
 observational
data and consensus opinion. The decision of whether hospitalization
 is
necessary should be based on the discretion of the health-care
 provider. </p>
<p>The following criteria for HOSPITALIZATION are based on
 observational
data and theoretical concerns: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Surgical emergencies such as appendicitis cannot be excluded; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The patient is pregnant; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The patient does not respond clinically to oral antimicrobial
 therapy; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The patient is unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral
 regimen; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The patient has severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or high
 fever; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The patient has a tubo-ovarian abscess; or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The patient is immunodeficient (i.e., has HIV infection with
 low CD4
    counts, is taking immunosuppressive therapy, or has another
 disease). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Most clinicians favor at least 24 hours of direct inpatient
 observation for
patients who have tubo-ovarian abscesses, after which time home
 parenteral
therapy should be adequate. </p>
<p>There are no efficacy data comparing parenteral with oral
 regimens.
Experts have extensive experience with both of the following
 regimens.
Also, there are multiple randomized trials demonstrating the
 efficacy of
each regimen. Although most trials have used parenteral treatment
 for at
least 48 hours after the patient demonstrates substantial clinical
improvement, this is an arbitrary designation. Clinical experience
 should
guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which may be
accomplished within 24 hours of clinical improvement. </p>
<p>Parenteral Regimen A </p>
<p>Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours,
OR
Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours,
PLUS
Doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours. </p>
<p>NOTE: Because of pain associated with infusion, doxycycline should
 be
administered orally when possible, even when the patient is
 hospitalized.
Both oral and IV administration of doxycycline provide similar
bioavailability. In the event that IV administration is necessary,
 use of
lidocaine or other short-acting local anesthetic, heparin, or
 steroids with
a steel needle or extension of the infusion time may reduce
 infusion
complications. Parenteral therapy may be discontinued 24 hours
 after a
patient improves clinically, and oral therapy with doxycycline (100
 mg
twice a day) should continue for a total of 14 days. When
 tubo-ovarian
abscess is present, many health-care providers use clindamycin or
metronidazole with doxycycline for continued therapy rather than
doxycycline alone, because it provides more effective anaerobic
 coverage. </p>
<p>Clinical data are limited regarding the use of other second- or

third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, and

ceftriaxone), which also might be effective therapy for PID and
 might
replace cefotetan or cefoxitin. However, they are less active than
cefotetan or cefoxitin against anaerobic bacteria. </p>
<p>Parenteral Regimen B </p>
<p>Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours,
PLUS
Gentamicin loading dose IV or IM (2 mg/kg of body weight),
 followed by
a maintenance dose (1.5 mg/kg) every 8 hours. Single daily
 dosing may
be substituted. </p>
<p>NOTE: Although use of a single daily dose of gentamicin has not
 been
evaluated for the treatment of PID, it is efficacious in other
 analogous
situations. Parenteral therapy may be discontinued 24 hours after a
 patient
improves clinically, and continuing oral therapy should consist of
doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day or clindamycin 450 mg orally
 four
times a day to complete a total of 14 days of therapy. When
 tubo-ovarian
abscess is present, many health-care providers use clindamycin for
continued therapy rather than doxycycline, because clindamycin
 provides
more effective anaerobic coverage. </p>
<p>Alternative Parenteral Regimens </p>
<p>Limited data support the use of other parenteral regimens, but
 the
following three regimens have been investigated in at least one
 clinical
trial, and they have broad spectrum coverage. </p>
<p>Ofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours,
PLUS
Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours.
OR
Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours,
PLUS
Doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours.
OR
Ciprofloxacin 200 mg IV every 12 hours,
PLUS
Doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours,
PLUS
Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours. </p>
<p>Ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline has good coverage against
 C.
trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and anaerobes and appears to be
 effective for
patients who have tubo-ovarian abscess. Both IV ofloxacin and
 ciprofloxacin
have been investigated as single agents. Because ciprofloxacin has
 poor
coverage against C. trachomatis, it is recommended that doxycycline
 be
added routinely. Because of concerns regarding the anaerobic
 coverage of
both quinolones, metronidazole should be included with each
 regimen. </p>
<p>Oral Treatment </p>
<p>As with parenteral regimens, clinical trials of outpatient
 regimens
have provided minimal information regarding intermediate and
 long-term
outcomes. The following regimens provide coverage against the
 frequent
etiologic agents of PID, but evidence from clinical trials
 supporting their
use is limited. Patients who do not respond to oral therapy within
 72 hours
should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and be administered
parenteral therapy on either an outpatient or inpatient basis. </p>
<p>Regimen A </p>
<p>Ofloxacin 400 mg orally twice a day for 14 days,
PLUS
Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days. </p>
<p>Oral ofloxacin has been investigated as a single agent in two
well-designed clinical trials, and it is effective against both N.
gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Despite the results of these
 trials,
ofloxacin's lack of anaerobic coverage is a concern; the addition
 of
metronidazole provides this coverage. </p>
<p>Regimen B </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM once,
OR
Cefoxitin 2 g IM plus Probenecid 1 g orally in a single dose
concurrently once,
OR
Other parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g.,
 ceftizoxime or
cefotaxime),
PLUS
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 14 days. (Include
 this
regimen with one of the above regimens.) </p>
<p>The optimal choice of a cephalosporin for Regimen B is unclear;

although cefoxitin has better anaerobic coverage, ceftriaxone has
 better
coverage against N. gonorrhoeae. Clinical trials have demonstrated
 that a
single dose of cefoxitin is effective in obtaining short-term
 clinical
response in women who have PID; however, the theoretical
 limitations in its
coverage of anaerobes may require the addition of metronidazole.
 The
metronidazole also will effectively treat BV, which also is
 frequently
associated with PID. No data have been published regarding the use
 of oral
cephalosporins for the treatment of PID. </p>
<p>Alternative Oral Regimens </p>
<p>Information regarding other outpatient regimens is limited, but
 one
other regimen has undergone at least one clinical trial and has
 broad
spectrum coverage. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plus doxycycline was

effective in obtaining short-term clinical response in a single
 clinical
trial; however, gastrointestinal symptoms might limit the overall
 success
of this regimen. Several recent investigations have evaluated the
 use of
azithromycin in the treatment of upper-reproductive tract
 infections;
however, the data are insufficient to recommend this agent as a
 component
of any of the treatment regimens for PID. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients receiving oral or parenteral therapy should
 demonstrate
substantial clinical improvement (e.g., defervescence; reduction in
 direct
or rebound abdominal tenderness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal,
 and
cervical motion tenderness) within 3 days after initiation of
 therapy.
Patients who do not demonstrate improvement within this time period
 usually
require additional diagnostic tests, surgical intervention, or
 both. </p>
<p>If the health-care provider prescribes outpatient oral or
 parenteral
therapy, a follow-up examination should be performed within 72
 hours, using
the criteria for clinical improvement described previously. Some
 experts
also recommend rescreening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae
 4-6 weeks
after therapy is completed. If PCR or LCR is used to document a
 test of
cure, rescreening should be delayed for 1 month after completion of

therapy. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Sex partners of patients who have PID should be examined and
 treated if
they had sexual contact with the patient during the 60 days
 preceding onset
of symptoms in the patient. The evaluation and treatment are
 imperative
because of the risk for reinfection and the strong likelihood of
 urethral
gonococcal or chlamydial infection in the sex partner. Male
 partners of
women who have PID caused by C. trachomatis and/or N. gonorrhoeae
 often are
asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Sex partners should be treated empirically with regimens
 effective
against both of these infections, regardless of the apparent
 etiology of
PID or pathogens isolated from the infected woman. </p>
<p>Even in clinical settings in which only women are treated,
 special
arrangements should be made to provide care for male sex partners
 of women
who have PID. When this is not feasible, health-care providers
 should
ensure that sex partners are referred for appropriate treatment. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Because of the high risk for maternal morbidity, fetal wastage,
 and
preterm delivery, pregnant women who have suspected PID should be
hospitalized and treated with parenteral antibiotics. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Differences in the clinical manifestations of PID between
 HIV-infected
women and HIV-negative women have not been well delineated. In
 early
observational studies, HIV-infected women with PID were more likely
 to
require surgical intervention. In a subsequent and more
 comprehensive
observational study, HIV-infected women who had PID had more severe

symptoms than HIV-negative women but responded equally well to
 standard
parenteral antibiotic regimens. In another study, the microbiologic

findings for HIV-infected and HIV-negative women were similar,
 except for
higher rates of concomitant Candida and HPV infections and
 HPV-related
cytologic abnormalities among HIV-infected women. Immunosuppressed
HIV-infected women who have PID should be managed aggressively
 using one of
the parenteral antimicrobial regimens recommended in this report. </p>
<br>
<p>EPIDIDYMITIS </p>
<p>Among sexually active men aged less than 35 years, epididymitis
 is most
often caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Epididymitis
 caused by
sexually transmitted E. coli infection also occurs among homosexual
 men who
are the insertive partners during anal intercourse. Sexually
 transmitted
epididymitis usually is accompanied by urethritis, which often is
asymptomatic. Nonsexually transmitted epididymitis associated with
 urinary
tract infections caused by Gram-negative enteric organisms occurs
 more
frequently among men aged greater than 35 years, men who have
 recently
undergone urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, and men who
 have
anatomical abnormalities. </p>
<p>Although most patients can be treated on an outpatient basis,
hospitalization should be considered when severe pain suggests
 other
diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, and abscess) or
 when
patients are febrile or might be noncompliant with an antimicrobial

regimen. </p>
<p>Diagnostic Considerations </p>
<p>Men who have epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular
 pain and
tenderness; hydrocele and palpable swelling of the epididymis
 usually are
present. Testicular torsion, a surgical emergency, should be
 considered in
all cases but is more frequent among adolescents. Torsion occurs
 more
frequently in patients who do not have evidence of inflammation or
infection. Emergency testing for torsion may be indicated when the
 onset of
pain is sudden, pain is severe, or the test results available
 during the
initial examination do not enable a diagnosis of urethritis or
 urinary
tract infection to be made. If the diagnosis is questionable, an
 expert
should be consulted immediately, because testicular viability may
 be
compromised. The evaluation of men for epididymitis should include
 the
following procedures: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    A Gram-stained smear of urethral exudate or intraurethral swab
 specimen
    for diagnosis of urethritis (i.e., greater than or equal to 5
    polymorphonuclear leukocytes per oil immersion field) and for
    presumptive diagnosis of gonococcal infection. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A culture of urethral exudate or intraurethral swab specimen,
 or
    nucleic acid amplification test (either on intraurethral swab
 or
    first-void urine) for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Examination of first-void urine for leukocytes if the urethral
 Gram
    stain is negative. Culture and Gram-stained smear of
 uncentrifuged
    urine should be obtained. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Syphilis serology and HIV counseling and testing. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Empiric therapy is indicated before culture results are
 available.
Treatment of epididymitis caused by C. trachomatis or N.
 gonorrhoeae will
result in a) a microbiologic cure of infection, b) improvement of
 the signs
and symptoms, c) prevention of transmission to others, and d) a
 decrease in
the potential complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>For epididymitis most likely caused by gonococcal or chlamydial

infection: </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose,
PLUS
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 10 days. </p>
<p>For epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms, or
 for
patients allergic to cephalosporins and/or tetracyclines: </p>
<p>Ofloxacin 300 mg orally twice a day for 10 days. </p>
<p>As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and
 analgesics
are recommended until fever and local inflammation have subsided. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Failure to improve within 3 days requires reevaluation of both
 the
diagnosis and therapy. Swelling and tenderness that persist after
completion of antimicrob-ial therapy should be evaluated
 comprehensively.
The differential diagnosis includes tumor, abscess, infarction,
 testicular
cancer, and tuberculous or fungal epididymitis. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Patients who have epididymitis that is known or suspected to be
 caused
by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be instructed to refer
 sex
partners for evaluation and treatment. Sex partners of these
 patients
should be referred if their contact with the index patient was
 within the
60 days preceding onset of symptoms in the patient. </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to avoid sexual intercourse until
 they
and their sex partners are cured. In the absence of a microbiologic
 test of
cure, this means until therapy is completed and patient and
 partner(s) no
longer have symptoms. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Patients who have uncomplicated epididymitis and also are
 infected with
HIV should receive the same treatment regimen as those who are
HIV-negative. Fungi and mycobacteria, however, are more likely to
 cause
epididymitis in immunosuppressed patients than in immunocompetent
 patients. </p>
<br>
<p>HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS INFECTION </p>
<p>Genital Warts </p>
<p>More than 20 types of HPV can infect the genital tract. Most
 HPV
infections are asymptomatic, subclinical, or unrecognized. Visible
 genital
warts usually are caused by HPV types 6 or 11. Other HPV types in
 the
anogenital region (i.e., types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35) have been
 strongly
associated with cervical dysplasia. Diagnosis of genital warts can
 be
confirmed by biopsy, although biopsy is rarely needed (e.g., if the

diagnosis is uncertain; the lesions do not respond to standard
 therapy; the
disease worsens during therapy; the patient is immunocompromised;
 or warts
are pigmented, indurated, fixed, and ulcerated). No data support
 the use of
type-specific HPV nucleic acid tests in the routine diagnosis or
 management
of visible genital warts. </p>
<p>HPV types 6 and 11 also can cause warts on the uterine cervix
 and in
the vagina, urethra, and anus; these warts are sometimes
 symptomatic.
Intra-anal warts are seen predominately in patients who have had
 receptive
anal intercourse; these warts are distinct from perianal warts,
 which can
occur in men and women who do not have a history of anal sex. Other
 than
the genital area, these HPV types have been associated with
 conjunctival,
nasal, oral, and laryngeal warts. HPV types 6 and 11 are associated
 rarely
with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the external genitalia.
 Depending
on the size and anatomic locations, genital warts can be painful,
 friable,
and/or pruritic. </p>
<p>HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 are found occasionally in
 visible
genital warts and have been associated with external genital (i.e.,
 vulvar,
penile, and anal) squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (i.e.,
 squamous cell
carcinoma in situ, bowen-oid papulosis, Erythroplasia of Queyrat,
 or
Bowen's disease of the genitalia). These HPV types have been
 associated
with vaginal, anal, and cervical intraepithelial dysplasia and
 squamous
cell carcinoma. Patients who have visible genital warts can be
 infected
simultaneously with multiple HPV types. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>The primary goal of treating visible genital warts is the
 removal of
symptomatic warts. Treatment can induce wart-free periods in most
 patients.
Genital warts often are asymptomatic. No evidence indicates that
 currently
available treatments eradicate or affect the natural history of HPV

infection. The removal of warts may or may not decrease
 infectivity. If
left untreated, visible genital warts may resolve on their own,
 remain
unchanged, or increase in size or number. No evidence indicates
 that
treatment of visible warts affects the development of cervical
 cancer. </p>
<p>Regimens </p>
<p>Treatment of genital warts should be guided by the preference
 of the
patient, the available resources, and the experience of the
 health-care
provider. None of the available treatments is superior to other
 treatments,
and no single treatment is ideal for all patients or all warts. </p>
<p>The available treatments for visible genital warts are
 patient-applied
therapies (i.e., podofilox and imiquimod) and provider-administered

therapies (i.e., cryotherapy, podophyllin resin, trichloroacetic
 acid
{TCA}, bichloroacetic acid {BCA}, interferon, and surgery). Most
 patients
have from one to 10 genital warts, with a total wart area of
 0.5-1.0 cm2,
that are responsive to most treatment modalities. Factors that
 might
influence selection of treatment include wart size, wart number,
 ana-tomic
site of wart, wart morphology, patient preference, cost of
 treatment,
convenience, adverse effects, and provider experience. Having a
 treatment
plan or protocol is important, because many patients will require a
 course
of therapy rather than a single treatment. In general, warts
 located on
moist surfaces and/or in intertriginous areas respond better to
 topical
treatment (e.g., TCA, podophyllin, podofilox, and imiquimod) than
 do warts
on drier surfaces. </p>
<p>The treatment modality should be changed if a patient has not
 improved
substantially after three provider-administered treatments or if
 warts have
not completely cleared after six treatments. The risk-benefit ratio
 of
treatment should be evaluated throughout the course of therapy to
 avoid
overtreatment. Providers should be knowledgeable about, and have
 available
to them, at least one patient-applied and one provider-administered

treatment. </p>
<p>Complications rarely occur if treatments for warts are employed

properly. Patients should be warned that scarring in the form of
 persistent
hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation is common with ablative
 modalities.
Depressed or hypertrophic scars are rare but can occur, especially
 if the
patient has had insufficient time to heal between treatments.
 Treatment can
result rarely in disabling chronic pain syndromes (e.g., vulvodynia
 or
hyperesthesia of the treatment site). </p>
<p>External Genital Warts, Recommended Treatments </p>
<p>Patient-Applied: </p>
<p>Podofilox 0.5% solution or gel. Patients may apply
 podofilox
solution with a cotton swab, or podofilox gel with a
 finger, to
visible genital warts twice a day for 3 days, followed by 4
 days of
no therapy. This cycle may be repeated as necessary for a
 total of
four cycles. The total wart area treated should not exceed
 10 cm2,
and a total volume of podofilox should not exceed 0.5 mL
 per day.
If possible, the health-care provider should apply the
 initial
treatment to demonstrate the proper application technique
 and
identify which warts should be treated. The safety of
 podofilox
during pregnancy has not been established.
OR
Imiquimod 5% cream. Patients should apply imiquimod cream
 with a
finger at bedtime, three times a week for as long as 16
 weeks. The
treatment area should be washed with mild soap and water
 6-10 hours
after the application. Many patients may be clear of warts
 by 8-10
weeks or sooner. The safety of imiquimod during pregnancy
 has not
been established. </p>
<p>Provider-Administered: </p>
<p>Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe. Repeat
 applications
every 1 to 2 weeks.
OR
Podophyllin resin 10%-25% in compound tincture of benzoin.
 A small
amount should be applied to each wart and allowed to air
 dry. To
avoid the possibility of complications associated with
 systemic
absorption and toxicity, some experts recommend that
 application be
limited to less than or equal to 0.5 mL of podophyllin or
 less than
or equal to 10 cm2 of warts per session. Some experts
 suggest that
the preparation should be thoroughly washed off 1-4 hours
 after
application to reduce local irritation. Repeat weekly if
 necessary.
The safety of podophyllin during pregnancy has not been
established.
OR
TCA or BCA 80%-90%. Apply a small amount only to warts and
 allow to
dry, at which time a white &quot;frosting&quot; develops; powder with
 talc or
sodium bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda) to remove unreacted
 acid if
an excess amount is applied. Repeat weekly if necessary.
OR
Surgical removal either by tangential scissor excision,
 tangential
shave excision, curettage, or electrosurgery. </p>
<p>External Genital Warts, Alternative Treatments </p>
<p>Intralesional interferon,
OR
Laser surgery. </p>
<p>For patient-applied treatments, patients must be able to
 identify and
reach warts to be treated. Podofilox 0.5% solution or gel is
 relatively
inexpensive, easy to use, safe, and self-applied by patients.
 Podofilox is
an antimitotic drug that results in destruction of warts. Most
 patients
experience mild/moderate pain or local irritation after treatment.
Imiquimod is a topically active immune enhancer that stimulates
 production
of interferon and other cytokines. Before wart resolution, local
inflammatory reactions are common; these reactions usually are mild
 to
moderate. </p>
<p>Cryotherapy, which requires the use of basic equipment,
 destroys warts
by thermal-induced cytolysis. Its major drawback is that proper use

requires substantial training, without which warts are frequently
overtreated or undertreated, resulting in poor efficacy or
 increased
likelihood of complications. Pain after application of the liquid
 nitrogen,
followed by necrosis and sometimes blistering, are not unusual.
 Although
local anesthesia (topical or injected) is not used routinely, its
 use
facilitates treatment if there are many warts or if the area of
 warts is
large. </p>
<p>Podophyllin resin contains a number of compounds, including the

podophyllin lignans that are antimitotic. The resin is most
 frequently
compounded at 10%-25% in tincture of benzoin. However, podophyllin
 resin
preparations differ in the concentration of active components and
contaminants. The shelf life and stability of podophyllin
 preparations are
unknown. It is important to apply a thin layer of podophyllin resin
 to the
warts and allow it to air dry before the treated area comes into
 contact
with clothing. Overapplication or failure to air dry can result in
 local
irritation caused by spread of the compound to adjacent areas. </p>
<p>Both TCA and BCA are caustic agents that destroy warts by
 chemical
coagulation of the proteins. Although these preparations are widely
 used,
they have not been investigated thoroughly. TCA solutions have a
 low
viscosity comparable to water and can spread rapidly if applied
excessively, thus damaging adjacent normal tissue. Both TCA and BCA
 should
be applied sparingly and allowed to dry before the patient sits or
 stands.
If pain is intense, the acid can be neutralized with soap or sodium

bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda). </p>
<p>Surgical removal of warts has an advantage over other treatment

modalities in that it renders the patient wart-free, usually with a
 single
visit. However, substantial clinical training, additional
 equipment, and a
longer office visit are required. Once local anesthesia is
 achieved, the
visible genital warts can be physically destroyed by
 electrosurgery, in
which case no additional hemostasis is required. Alternatively, the
 warts
can be removed either by tangential excision with a pair of fine
 scissors
or a scalpel or by curettage. Because most warts are exophytic,
 this can be
accomplished with a resulting wound that only extends into the
 upper
dermis. Hemostasis can be achieved with an electrosurgical unit or
 a
chemical styptic (e.g., an aluminum chloride solution). Suturing is
 neither
required nor indicated in most cases when surgical removal is done
properly. Surgery is most beneficial for patients who have a large
 number
or area of genital warts. Carbon dioxide laser and surgery may be
 useful in
the management of extensive warts or intraurethral warts,
 particularly for
those patients who have not responded to other treatments. </p>
<p>Interferons, either natural or recombinant, used for the
 treatment of
genital warts have been administered systemically (i.e.,
 subcutaneously at
a distant site or IM) and intralesionally (i.e., injected into the
 warts).
Systemic interferon is not effective. The efficacy and recurrence
 rates of
intralesional interferon are comparable to other treatment
 modalities.
Interferon is believed to be effective because of antiviral and/or
immunostimulating effects. However, interferon therapy is not
 recommended
for routine use because of inconvenient routes of administration,
 frequent
office visits, and the association between its use and a high
 frequency of
systemic adverse effects. </p>
<p>Because of the shortcomings of available treatments, some
 clinics
employ combination therapy (i.e., the simultaneous use of two or
 more
modalities on the same wart at the same time). Most experts believe
 that
combining modalities does not increase efficacy but may increase
complications. </p>
<p>Cervical Warts </p>
<p>For women who have exophytic cervical warts, high-grade
 squamous
intraepithelial lesions (SIL) must be excluded before treatment is
 begun.
Management of exophytic cervical warts should include consultation
 with an
expert. </p>
<p>Vaginal Warts </p>
<p>Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen. The use of a cryoprobe in the
 vagina
is not recommended because of the risk for vaginal perforation
 and
fistula formation.
OR
TCA or BCA 80%-90% applied only to warts. Apply a small amount
 only to
warts and allow to dry, at which time a white &quot;frosting&quot;
 develops;
powder with talc or sodium bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda) to
 remove
unreacted acid if an excess amount is applied. Repeat weekly if

necessary.
OR
Podophyllin 10%-25% in compound tincture of benzoin applied to
 a
treated area that must be dry before the speculum is removed.
 Treat
with less than or equal to 2 cm2 per session. Repeat
 application at
weekly intervals. Because of concern about potential systemic
absorption, some experts caution against vaginal application of

podophyllin. The safety of podophyllin during pregnancy has not
 been
established. </p>
<p>Urethral Meatus Warts </p>
<p>Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen,
OR
Podophyllin 10%-25% in compound tincture of benzoin. The
 treatment area
must be dry before contact with normal mucosa. Podophyllin must
 be
applied weekly if necessary. The safety of podophyllin during
 pregnancy
has not been established. </p>
<p>Anal Warts </p>
<p>Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen.
OR
TCA or BCA 80%-90% applied to warts. Apply a small amount only
 to warts
and allow to dry, at which time a white &quot;frosting&quot; develops;
 powder
with talc or sodium bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda) to remove
 unreacted
acid if an excess amount is applied. Repeat weekly if
 necessary.
OR
Surgical removal. </p>
<p>Note: Management of warts on rectal mucosa should be referred
 to an
expert. </p>
<p>Oral Warts </p>
<p>Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen,
OR
Surgical removal. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>After visible genital warts have cleared, a follow-up
 evaluation is not
mandatory. Patients should be cautioned to watch for recurrences,
 which
occur most frequently during the first 3 months. Because the
 sensitivity
and specificity of self-diagnosis of genital warts is unknown,
 patients
concerned about recurrences should be offered a follow-up
 evaluation 3
months after treatment. Earlier follow-up visits also may be useful
 a) to
document a wart-free state, b) to monitor for or treat
 complications of
therapy, and c) to provide the opportunity for patient education
 and
counseling. Women should be counseled regarding the need for
 regular
cytologic screening as recommended for women without genital warts.
 The
presence of genital warts is not an indication for cervical
 colposcopy. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Examination of sex partners is not necessary for the management
 of
genital warts because the role of reinfection is probably minimal
 and, in
the absence of curative therapy, treatment to reduce transmission
 is not
realistic. However, because self- or partner-examination has not
 been
evaluated as a diagnostic method for genital warts, sex partners of

patients who have genital warts may benefit from examination to
 assess the
presence of genital warts and other STDs. Sex partners also might
 benefit
from counseling about the implications of having a partner who has
 genital
warts. Because treatment of genital warts probably does not
 eliminate the
HPV infection, patients and sex partners should be cautioned that
 the
patient might remain infectious even though the warts are gone. The
 use of
condoms may reduce, but does not eliminate, the risk for
 transmission to
uninfected partners. Female sex partners of patients who have
 genital warts
should be reminded that cytologic screening for cervical cancer is
recommended for all sexually active women. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Imiquimod, podophyllin, and podofilox should not be used during

pregnancy. Because genital warts can proliferate and become friable
 during
pregnancy, many experts advocate their removal during pregnancy.
 HPV types
6 and 11 can cause laryngeal papillomatosis in infants and
 children. The
route of transmission (i.e., transplacental, perinatal, or
 postnatal) is
not completely understood. The preventive value of cesarean section
 is
unknown; thus, cesarean delivery should not be performed solely to
 prevent
transmission of HPV infection to the newborn. In rare instances,
 cesarean
delivery may be indicated for women with genital warts if the
 pelvic outlet
is obstructed or if vaginal delivery would result in excessive
 bleeding. </p>
<p>Immunosuppressed Patients </p>
<p>Persons who are immunosuppressed because of HIV or other
 reasons may
not respond as well as immunocompetent persons to therapy for
 genital
warts, and they may have more frequent recurrences after treatment.

Squamous cell carcinomas arising in or resembling genital warts
 might occur
more frequently among immunosuppressed persons, requiring more
 frequent
biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis. </p>
<p>Squamous Cell Carcinoma in situ </p>
<p>Patients in whom squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the
 genitalia is
diagnosed should be referred to an expert for treatment. Ablative
modalities usually are effective, but careful follow-up is
 important. The
risk for these lesions leading to invasive squamous cell carcinoma
 of the
external genitalia in immunocompetent patients is unknown but is
 probably
low. Female partners of patients who have squamous cell carcinoma
 in situ
are at high risk for cervical abnormalities. </p>
<p>Subclinical Genital HPV Infection (Without Exophytic Warts) </p>
<p>Subclinical genital HPV infection occurs more frequently than
 visible
genital warts among both men and women. Infection often is
 indirectly
diagnosed on the cervix by Pap smear, colposcopy, or biopsy and on
 the
penis, vulva, and other genital skin by the appearance of white
 areas after
application of acetic acid. However, the routine use of acetic acid
 soaks
and examination with light and magnification, as a screening test,
 to
detect &quot;subclinical&quot; or &quot;acetowhite&quot; genital warts is not
 recommended.
Acetowhitening is not a specific test for HPV infection. Thus, in
populations at low risk for this infection, many false-positives
 may be
detected when this test is used for screening. The specificity and
sensitivity of this procedure has not been defined. In special
 situations,
experienced clinicians find this test useful for identification of
 flat
genital warts. </p>
<p>A definitive diagnosis of HPV infection depends on detection of
 viral
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) or capsid protein. Pap smear diagnosis of
 HPV
does not always correlate with detection of HPV DNA in cervical
 cells. Cell
changes attributed to HPV in the cervix are similar to those of
 mild
dysplasia and often regress spontaneously without treatment. Tests
 that
detect several types of HPV DNA or RNA in cells scraped from the
 cervix are
available, but the clinical utility of these tests for managing
 patients is
unclear. Management decisions should not be made on the basis of
 HPV tests.
Screening for subclinical genital HPV infection using DNA or RNA
 tests or
acetic acid is not recommended. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>In the absence of coexistent dysplasia, treatment is not
 recommended
for subclinical genital HPV infection diagnosed by Pap smear,
 colposcopy,
biopsy, acetic acid soaking of genital skin or mucous membranes, or
 the
detection of HPV (DNA or RNA). The diagnosis of subclinical genital
 HPV
infection is often questionable, and no therapy has been identified
 to
eradicate infection. HPV has been demonstrated in adjacent tissue
 after
laser treatment of HPV-associated dysplasia and after attempts to
 eliminate
subclinical HPV by extensive laser vaporization of the anogenital
 area. In
the presence of coexistent dysplasia, management should be based on
 the
grade of dysplasia. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Examination of sex partners is unnecessary. Most sex partners
 of
infected patients probably are already infected subclinically with
 HPV. No
practical screening tests for subclinical infection are available.
 The use
of condoms may reduce transmission to sex partners who are likely
 to be
uninfected (e.g., new partners); however, the period of
 communicability is
unknown. Whether patients who have subclinical HPV infection are as

contagious as patients who have exophytic warts is unknown. </p>
<br>
<p>CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING FOR WOMEN WHO ATTEND STD CLINICS OR HAVE
 A
HISTORY OF STDs </p>
<p>Women who have a history of STD are at increased risk for
 cervical
cancer, and women attending STD clinics may have other risk factors
 that
place them at even greater risk. Prevalence studies have determined
 that
precursor lesions for cervical cancer occur about five times more
frequently among women attending STD clinics than among women
 attending
family planning clinics. </p>
<p>The Pap smear (i.e., cervical smear) is an effective and
 relatively
low-cost screening test for invasive cervical cancer and SIL, * the

precursors of cervical cancer. Both ACOG and the American Cancer
 Society
(ACS) recommend annual Pap smears for all sexually active women.
 Although
these guidelines take the position that Pap smears can be obtained
 less
frequently in some situations, women with a history of STDs may
 need more
frequent screening because of their increased risk for cervical
 cancer.
Moreover, surveys of women attending STD clinics indicate that many
 women
do not understand the purpose or importance of Pap smears, and
 almost half
of the women who have had a pelvic examination erroneously believe
 they
have had a Pap smear when they actually have not.

and discuss the following information with the patient: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    The purpose and importance of a Pap smear; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Whether a Pap smear was obtained during the clinic visit; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The need for an annual Pap smear; and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The names of local providers or referral clinics that can
 obtain Pap
    smears and adequately follow up results (i.e., if a Pap smear
 was not
    obtained during this examination). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If a woman has not had a Pap smear during the previous 12
 months, a Pap
smear should be obtained as part of the routine pelvic examination.

Health-care providers should be aware that, after a pelvic
 examination,
many women believe they have had a Pap smear when they actually
 have not,
and thus may report having had a recent Pap smear. Therefore, in
 STD
clinics, a Pap smear should be strongly considered during the
 routine
clinical evaluation of women who have not had a normal Pap smear
 within the
preceding 12 months that is documented within the clinic record or
linked-system record. </p>
<p>A woman may benefit from receiving printed information about
 Pap smears
and a report containing a statement that a Pap smear was obtained
 during
her clinic visit. If possible, a copy of the Pap smear result
 should be
provided to the patient for her records. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Clinics and health-care providers who provide Pap smear
 screening
services are encouraged to use cytopathology laboratories that
 report
results using the Bethesda System of classification. If the results
 of the
Pap smear are abnormal, care should be provided according to the
 Interim
Guidelines for Management of Abnormal Cervical Cytology published
 by the
National Cancer Institute Consensus Panel and briefly summarized
 below
(27). Appropriate follow-up of Pap smears showing a high-grade SIL
 always
includes referral to a clinician who has the capacity to provide a
colposcopic examination of the lower genital tract and, if
 indicated,
colposcopically directed biopsies. For a Pap smear showing
 low-grade SIL or
atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS),
 follow-up
without colposcopy may be acceptable in circumstances when the
 diagnosis is
not qualified further or the cytopathologist favors a reactive
 process. In
general, this would involve repeated Pap smears every 4-6 months
 for 2
years until the results of three consecutive smears have been
 negative. If
repeated smears show persistent abnormalities, colposcopy and
 directed
biopsy are indicated for low-grade SIL and should be considered for
 ASCUS.
Women with a diagnosis of unqualified ASCUS associated with severe
inflammation should at least be reevaluated with a repeat Pap smear
 after
2-3 months, then repeated Pap smears every 4-6 months for 2 years
 until the
results of three consecutive smears have been negative. If specific

infections are identified, the patient should be reevaluated after
appropriate treatment for those infections. In all follow-up
 strategies
using repeated Pap smears, the tests not only must be negative but
 also
must be interpreted by the laboratory as &quot;satisfactory for
 evaluation.&quot; </p>
<p>Because many public health clinics, including most STD clinics,
 cannot
provide clinical follow-up of abnormal Pap smears with colposcopy
 and
biopsy, women with Pap smears demonstrating high grade SIL or
 persistent
low-grade SIL or ASCUS usually will need a referral to other local
health-care providers or clinics for colposcopy and biopsy. Clinics
 and
health-care providers who offer Pap smear screening services but
 cannot
provide appropriate colposcopic follow-up of abnormal Pap smears
 should
arrange referral services that a) can promptly evaluate and treat
 patients
and b) will report the results of the evaluation to the referring
 clinician
or health-care provider. Clinics and health-care providers should
 develop
protocols that identify women who miss initial appointments (i.e.,
 so that
these women can be scheduled for repeat Pap smears), and they
 should
reevaluate such protocols routinely. Pap smear results, type and
 location
of follow-up appointments, and results of follow-up should be
 clearly
documented in the clinic record. The development of colposcopy and
 biopsy
services in local health departments, especially in circumstances
 where
referrals are difficult and follow-up is unlikely, should be
 considered. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Other considerations in performing Pap smears are as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    The Pap smear is not an effective screening test for STDs. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    If a woman is menstruating, a Pap smear should be postponed,
 and the
    woman should be advised to have a Pap smear at the earliest
    opportunity. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The presence of a mucopurulent discharge might compromise
    interpretation of the Pap smear. However, if the woman is
 unlikely to
    return for follow-up, a Pap smear can be obtained after careful
 removal
    of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A woman who has external genital warts does not need to have
 Pap smears
    more frequently than a woman who does not have warts, unless
 otherwise
    indicated. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    In an STD clinic setting or when other cultures or specimens
 are
    collected for STD diagnoses, the Pap smear may be obtained
 last. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Women who have had a hysterectomy do not require an annual Pap
 smear
    unless the hysterectomy was related to cervical cancer or its
 precursor
    lesions. In this situation, women should be advised to continue

    follow-up with the physician(s) who provided health care at the
 time of
    the hysterectomy. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Both health-care providers who receive basic retraining on Pap
 smear
    collection and clinics that use simple quality assurance
 measures
    obtain fewer unsatisfactory smears. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Although type-specific HPV testing to identify women at high
 and low
    risk for cervical cancer may become clinically relevant in the
 future,
    its utility in clinical practice is unclear, and such testing
 is not
    recommended. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Women who are pregnant should have a Pap smear as part of
 routine
prenatal care. A cytobrush may be used for obtaining Pap smears in
 pregnant
women, although care should be taken not to disrupt the mucous
 plug. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Several studies have documented an increased prevalence of SIL
 in
HIV-infected women, and HIV is believed by many experts to hasten
 the
progression of precursor lesions to invasive cervical cancer. The
 following
recommendations for Pap smear screening among HIV-infected women
 are
consistent with other guidelines published by the U.S. Department
 of Health
and Human Services (10,11,27,28) and are based partially on the
 opinions of
experts in the care and management of cervical cancer and HIV
 infection in
women. </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    After obtaining a complete history of previous cervical
 disease,
    HIV-infected women should have a comprehensive gynecologic
 examination,
    including a pelvic examination and Pap smear as part of their
 initial
    evaluation. A Pap smear should be obtained twice in the first
 year
    after diagnosis of HIV infection and, if the results are
 normal,
    annually thereafter. If the results of the Pap smear are
 abnormal, care
    should be provided according to the Interim Guidelines for
 Management
    of Abnormal Cervical Cytology (28). Women who have a
 cytological
    diagnosis of high-grade SIL or squamous cell carcinoma should
 undergo
    colposcopy and directed biopsy. HIV infection is not an
 indication for
    colposcopy in women who have normal Pap smears. </p>
<br>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>VACCINE-PREVENTABLE STDs </p>
<p>One of the most effective means of preventing the transmission
 of STDs
is preexposure immunization. Currently licensed vaccines for the
 prevention
of STDs include those for hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Clinical
 development
and trials are underway for vaccines against a number of other
 STDs,
including HIV and HSV. As more vaccines become available,
 immunization
possibly will become one of the most widespread methods used to
 prevent
STDs. </p>
<p>Five different viruses (i.e., hepatitis A-E) account for almost
 all
cases of viral hepatitis in humans. Serologic testing is necessary
 to
confirm the diagnosis. For example, a health-care provider might
 assume
that an injecting-drug user with jaundice has hepatitis B when, in
 fact,
outbreaks of hepatitis A among injecting-drug users often occur.
 The
correct diagnosis is essential for the delivery of appropriate
 preventive
services. To ensure accurate reporting of viral hepatitis and
 appropriate
prophylaxis of household contacts and sex partners, all case
 reports of
viral hepatitis should be investigated and the etiology established
 through
serologic testing. </p>
<p>Hepatitis A </p>
<p>Hepatitis A is caused by infection with the hepatitis A virus
 (HAV).
HAV replicates in the liver and is shed in the feces. Virus in the
 stool is
found in the highest concentrations from 2 weeks before to 1 week
 after the
onset of clinical illness. Virus also is present in serum and
 saliva during
this period, although in much lower concentrations than in feces.
 The most
common mode of HAV transmission is fecal-oral, either by
 person-to-person
transmission between household contacts or sex partners or by
 contaminated
food or water. Because viremia occurs in acute infection,
 bloodborne HAV
transmission can occur; however, such cases have been reported
infrequently. Although HAV is present in low concentrations in the
 saliva
of infected persons, no evidence indicates that saliva is involved
 in
transmission. </p>
<p>Of patients who have acute hepatitis A, less than or equal to
 20%
require hospitalization; fulminant liver failure develops in 0.1%
 of
patients. The overall mortality rate for acute hepatitis A is 0.3%,
 but it
is higher (1.8%) for adults aged greater than 49 years. HAV
 infection is
not associated with chronic liver disease. </p>
<p>In the United States during 1995, 31,582 cases of hepatitis A
 were
reported. The most frequently reported source of infection was
 household or
sexual contact with a person who had hepatitis A, followed by
 attendance or
employment at a day care center; recent international travel;
 homosexual
activity; injecting-drug use; and a suspected food or waterborne
 outbreak.
Many persons who have hepatitis A do not identify risk factors;
 their
source of infection may be other infected persons who are
 asymptomatic. The
prevalence of previous HAV infection among the U.S. population is
 33% (CDC,
unpublished data). </p>
<p>Outbreaks of hepatitis A among homosexual men have been
 reported in
urban areas, both in the United States and in foreign countries. In
 one
investigation, the prevalence of HAV infection among homosexual men
 was
significantly higher (30%) than that among heterosexual men (12%).
 In New
York City, a case-control study of homosexual men who had acute
 hepatitis A
determined that case-patients were more likely to have had more
 anonymous
sex partners and to have engaged in group sex than were the control

subjects; oral-anal intercourse (i.e., the oral role) and
 digital-rectal
intercourse (i.e., the digital role) also were associated with
 illness. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Because HAV infection is self-limited and does not result in
 chronic
infection or chronic liver disease, treatment is usually
 supportive.
Hospitalization may be necessary for patients who are dehydrated
 because of
nausea and vomiting or who have fulminant hepatitis A. Medications
 that
might cause liver damage or that are metabolized by the liver
 should be
used with caution. No specific diet or activity restrictions are
 necessary. </p>
<p>Prevention </p>
<p>General measures for hepatitis A prevention (e.g., maintenance
 of good
personal hygiene) have not been successful in interrupting
 outbreaks of
hepatitis A when the mode of transmission is from person to person,

including sexual contact. To help control hepatitis A outbreaks
 among
homosexual and bisexual men, health education messages should
 stress the
modes of HAV transmission and the measures that can be taken to
 reduce the
risk for transmission of any STD, including enterically transmitted
 agents
such as HAV. However, vaccination is the most effective means of
 preventing
HAV infection. </p>
<p>Two types of products are available for the prevention of
 hepatitis A:
immune globulin (IG) and hepatitis A vaccine. IG is a solution of
antibodies prepared from human plasma that is made with a serial
 ethanol
precipitation procedure that inactivates HBV and HIV. When
 administered
intramuscularly before exposure to HAV, or within 2 weeks after
 exposure,
IG is greater than 85% effective in preventing hepatitis A. IG
administration is recommended for a variety of exposure situations
 (e.g.,
for persons who have sexual or household contact with patients who
 have
hepatitis A). The duration of protection is relatively short (i.e.,
 3-6
months) and dose dependent. </p>
<p>Inactivated hepatitis A vaccines have been available in the
 United
States since 1995. These vaccines, administered as a two-dose
 series, are
safe, highly immunogenic, and efficacious. Immunogenicity studies
 indicate
that 99%-100% of persons respond to one dose of hepatitis A
 vaccine; the
second dose provides long-term protection. Efficacy studies
 indicate that
inactivated hepatitis A vaccines are 94%-100% effective in
 preventing HAV
infection (2). </p>
<p>Preexposure Prophylaxis </p>
<p>Vaccination with hepatitis A vaccine for preexposure protection
 against
HAV infection is indicated for persons who have the following risk
 factors
and who are likely to seek treatment in settings where STDs are
 being
treated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Men who have sex with men. Sexually active men who have sex
 with men
    (both adolescents and adults) should be vaccinated. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Illegal drug users. Vaccination is recommended for users of
 illegal
    injecting and noninjecting drugs if local epidemiologic
 evidence
    indicates previous or current outbreaks among persons with such
 risk
    behaviors. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Postexposure Prophylaxis </p>
<p>Persons who were exposed recently to HAV (i.e., household or
 sexual
contact with a person who has hepatitis A) and who had not been
 vaccinated
before the exposure should be administered a single IM dose of IG
 (0.02
mL/kg) as soon as possible, but not greater than 2 weeks after
 exposure.
Persons who received at least one dose of hepatitis A vaccine
 greater than
or equal to 1 month before exposure to HAV do not need IG. </p>
<p>Hepatitis B </p>
<p>Hepatitis B is a common STD. During the past 10 years, sexual
transmission accounted for approximately 30%-60% of the estimated
 240,000
new HBV infections that occurred annually in the United States.
 Chronic HBV
infection develops in 1%-6% of persons infected as adults. These
 persons
are capable of transmitting HBV to others, and they are at risk for
 chronic
liver disease. In the United States, HBV infection leads to an
 estimated
6,000 deaths annually; these deaths result from cirrhosis of the
 liver and
primary hepatocellular carcinoma. </p>
<p>The risk for perinatal HBV infection among infants born to
 HBV-infected
mothers is 10%-85%, depending on the mother's hepatitis B e antigen
 (HbeAg)
status. Chronic HBV infection develops in approximately 90% of
 infected
newborns; these children are at high risk for chronic liver
 disease. Even
when not infected during the perinatal period, children of
 HBV-infected
mothers are at high risk for acquiring chronic HBV infection by
person-to-person transmission during the first 5 years of life. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>No specific treatment is available for persons who have acute
 HBV
infection. Supportive and symptomatic care usually are the
 mainstays of
therapy. During the past decade, numerous antiviral agents have
 been
investigated for treatment of chronic HBV infection. Alpha-2b
 interferon
has been 40% effective in eliminating chronic HBV infection;
 persons who
became infected during adulthood were most likely to respond to
 this
treatment. Antiretroviral agents (e.g., lamivudine) have been
 effective in
eliminating HBV infection, and a number of other compounds are
 being
evaluated. The goal of antiviral treatment is to stop HBV
 replication.
Response to treatment can be demonstrated by normalization of liver

function tests, improvement in liver histology, and seroreversion
 from
HBeAg-positive to HBeAg-negative. Long-term follow-up of treated
 patients
suggests that the remission of chronic hepatitis induced by alpha
interferon is of long duration. Patient characteristics associated
 with
positive response to interferon therapy include low pretherapy HBV
 DNA
levels, high pretherapy alanine aminotransferase levels, short
 duration of
infection, acquisition of disease in adulthood, active histology,
 and
female sex. </p>
<p>Prevention </p>
<p>Although methods used to prevent other STDs should prevent HBV
infection, hepatitis B vaccination is the most effective means of
preventing infection. The epidemiology of HBV infection in the
 United
States indicates that multiple age groups must be targeted to
 provide
widespread immunity and effectively prevent HBV transmission and
HBV-related chronic liver disease (1). Vaccination of persons who
 have a
history of STDs is part of a comprehensive strategy to eliminate
 HBV
transmission in the United States. This comprehensive strategy also

includes prevention of perinatal HBV infection by a) routine
 screening of
all pregnant women, b) routine vaccination of all newborns, c)
 vaccination
of older children at high risk for HBV infection (e.g., Alaskan
 Natives,
Pacific Islanders, and residents in households of first-generation
immigrants from countries in which HBV is of high or intermediate
endemicity), d) vaccination of children aged 11-12 years who have
 not
previously received hepatitis B vaccine, and e) vaccination of
 adolescents
and adults at high risk for infection. </p>
<p>Preexposure Prophylaxis </p>
<p>With the implementation of routine infant hepatitis B
 vaccination and
the wide-scale implementation of vaccination programs for
 adolescents,
vaccination of adults at high risk for HBV has become a priority in
 the
strategy to eliminate HBV transmission in the United States. All
 persons
attending STD clinics and persons known to be at high risk for HBV
infection (e.g., persons with multiple sex partners, sex partners
 of
persons with chronic HBV infection, and injecting-drug users)
 should be
offered hepatitis B vaccine and advised of their risk for HBV
 infection (as
well as their risk for HIV infection) and the means to reduce their
 risk
(i.e., exclusivity in sexual relationships, use of condoms, and
 avoidance
of nonsterile drug-injection equipment). </p>
<p>Persons who should receive hepatitis B vaccine include the
 following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Sexually active homosexual and bisexual men; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Sexually active heterosexual men and women, including those a)
 in whom
    another STD was recently diagnosed, b) who had more than one
 sex
    partner in the preceding 6 months, c) who received treatment in
 an STD
    clinic, and d) who are prostitutes; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Illegal drug users, including injecting-drug users and users of
 illegal
    noninjecting drugs; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Health-care workers; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Recipients of certain blood products; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Household and sexual contacts of persons who have chronic HBV
    infection; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Adoptees from countries in which HBV infection is endemic; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Certain international travelers; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Clients and employees of facilities for the developmentally
 disabled; </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Infants and children; and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Hemodialysis patients. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Screening for Antibody Versus Vaccination Without Screening </p>
<p>The prevalence of previous HBV infection among sexually active
homosexual men and among injecting-drug users is high. Serologic
 screening
for evidence of previous infection before vaccinating adult members
 of
these groups may be cost-effective, depending on the costs of
 laboratory
testing and vaccine. At the current cost of vaccine, prevaccination
 testing
on adolescents is not cost-effective. For adults attending STD
 clinics, the
prevalence of HBV infection and the vaccine cost may justify
 prevaccination
testing. However, because prevaccination testing may lower
 compliance with
vaccination, the first dose of vaccine should be administered at
 the time
of testing. The additional doses of hepatitis vaccine should be
administered on the basis of the prevaccination test results. The
 preferred
serologic test for prevaccination testing is the total antibody to
hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), because it will detect persons
 who
have either resolved or chronic infection. Because anti-HBc testing
 will
not identify persons immune to HBV infection as a result of
 vaccination, a
history of hepatitis B vaccination should be obtained, and fully
 vaccinated
persons should not be revaccinated. </p>
<p>Vaccination Schedules </p>
<p>Hepatitis B vaccine is highly immunogenic. Protective levels of

antibody are present in approximately 50% of young adults after one
 dose of
vaccine; in 85%, after two doses; and greater than 90%, after three
 doses.
The third dose is required to provide long-term immunity. The most
 often
used schedule is vaccination at 0, 1-2, and 4-6 months. The first
 and
second doses of vaccine must be administered at least 1 month
 apart, and
the first and third doses at least 4 months apart. If the
 vaccination
series is interrupted after the first or second dose of vaccine,
 the
missing dose should be administered as soon as possible. The series
 should
not be restarted if a dose has been missed. The vaccine should be
administered IM in the deltoid, not in the buttock. </p>
<p>Postexposure Prophylaxis </p>
<p>Exposure to Persons Who Have Acute Hepatitis B </p>
<p>Sexual Contacts </p>
<p>Patients who have acute HBV infection are potentially
 infectious to
persons with whom they have sexual contact. Passive immunization
 with
hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) prevents 75% of these
 infections.
Hepatitis B vaccination alone is less effective in preventing
 infection
than HBIG and vaccination. Sexual contacts of patients who have
 acute
hepatitis B should receive HBIG and begin the hepatitis B vaccine
 series
within 14 days after the most recent sexual contact. Testing of sex

partners for susceptibility to HBV infection (anti-HBc) can be
 considered
if it does not delay treatment greater than 14 days. </p>
<p>Nonsexual Household Contacts </p>
<p>Nonsexual household contacts of patients who have acute
 hepatitis B are
not at high risk for infection unless they are exposed to the
 patient's
blood (e.g., by sharing a toothbrush or razor blade). However,
 vaccination
of household contacts is encouraged, especially for children and
adolescents. If the patient remains HBsAg-positive after 6 months
 (i.e.,
becomes chronically infected), all household contacts should be
 vaccinated. </p>
<p>Exposure to Persons Who Have Chronic HBV Infection </p>
<p>Hepatitis B vaccination without the use of HBIG is highly
 effective in
preventing HBV infection in household and sexual contacts of
 persons who
have chronic HBV infection, and all such contacts should be
 vaccinated.
Postvaccination serologic testing is indicated for sex partners of
 persons
who have chronic hepatitis B infections and for infants born to
HBsAg-positive women. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnancy is not a contraindication to hepatitis B vaccine or
 HBIG
vaccine administration. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>HBV infection in HIV-infected persons is more likely to lead to
 chronic
HBV infection. HIV infection also can impair the response to
 hepatitis B
vaccine. Therefore, HIV-infected persons who are vaccinated should
 be
tested for hepatitis B surface antibody 1-2 months after the third
 vaccine
dose. Revaccination with three more doses should be considered for
 those
who do not respond initially to vaccination. Those who do not
 respond to
additional doses should be advised that they might remain
 susceptible to
HBV infection. </p>
<br>
<p>PROCTITIS, PROCTOCOLITIS, AND ENTERITIS </p>
<p>Sexually transmitted gastrointestinal syndromes include
 proctitis,
proctocolitis, and enteritis. Proctitis occurs predominantly among
 persons
who participate in anal intercourse, and enteritis occurs among
 those whose
sexual practices include oral-fecal contact. Proctocolitis can be
 acquired
by either route, depending on the pathogen. Evaluation should
 include
appropriate diagnostic procedures (e.g., anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy,
 stool
examination, and culture). </p>
<p>Proctitis is an inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal
 10-12
cm) that is associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, and rectal
 discharge.
N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis (including LGV serovars), T.
 pallidum, and
HSV usually are the sexually transmitted pathogens involved. In
 patients
coinfected with HIV, herpes proctitis may be especially severe. </p>
<p>Proctocolitis is associated with symptoms of proctitis plus
 diarrhea
and/or abdominal cramps and inflammation of the colonic mucosa
 extending to
12 cm. Fecal leukocytes may be detected on stool examination
 depending on
the pathogen. Pathogenic organisms include Campylobacter sp.,
 Shigella sp.,
Entamoeba histolytica, and, rarely, C. trachomatis (LGV serovars).
 CMV or
other opportunistic agents may be involved in immunosuppressed
 HIV-infected
patients. </p>
<p>Enteritis usually results in diarrhea and abdominal cramping
 without
signs of proctitis or proctocolitis. In otherwise healthy patients,
 Giardia
lamblia is most frequently implicated. Among HIV-infected patients,
 other
infections that usually are not sexually transmitted may occur,
 including
CMV, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Salmonella sp.,
 Cryptosporidium,
Microsporidium, and Isospora. Multiple stool examinations may be
 necessary
to detect Giardia, and special stool preparations are required to
 diagnose
cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis. Additionally, enteritis may
 be a
primary effect of HIV infection. </p>
<p>When laboratory diagnostic capabilities are available,
 treatment should
be based on the specific diagnosis. Diagnostic and treatment
recommendations for all enteric infections are beyond the scope of
 these
guidelines. </p>
<p>Treatment </p>
<p>Acute proctitis of recent onset among persons who have recently

practiced receptive anal intercourse is most often sexually
 transmitted.
Such patients should be examined by anoscopy and should be
 evaluated for
infection with HSV, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and T.
 pallidum. If
anorectal pus is found on examination, or if polymorphonuclear
 leukocytes
are found on a Gram-stained smear of anorectal secretions, the
 following
therapy may be prescribed pending results of additional laboratory
 tests. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM (or another agent effective against anal
 and
genital gonorrhea),
PLUS
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>NOTE: For patients who have herpes proctitis, refer to Genital
 Herpes
Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Follow-up should be based on specific etiology and severity of
 clinical
symptoms. Reinfection may be difficult to distinguish from
 treatment
failure. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Sex partners of patients who have sexually transmitted enteric
infections should be evaluated for any diseases diagnosed in the
 patient. </p>
<br>
<p>ECTOPARASITIC INFECTIONS </p>
<p>Pediculosis Pubis </p>
<p>Patients who have pediculosis pubis (i.e., pubic lice) usually
 seek
medical attention because of pruritus. Such patients also usually
 notice
lice or nits on their pubic hair. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimens </p>
<p>Permethrin 1% creme rinse applied to affected areas and washed
 off
after 10 minutes.
OR
Lindane 1% shampoo applied for 4 minutes to the affected area,
 and then
thoroughly washed off. This regimen is not recommended for
 pregnant or
lactating women or for children aged less than 2 years.
OR
Pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area
 and
washed off after 10 minutes. </p>
<p>The lindane regimen is the least expensive therapy; toxicity,
 as
indicated by seizure and aplastic anemia, has not been reported
 when
treatment was limited to the recommended 4-minute period.
 Permethrin has
less potential for toxicity than lindane. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>The recommended regimens should not be applied to the eyes.
 Pediculosis
of the eyelashes should be treated by applying occlusive ophthalmic

ointment to the eyelid margins twice a day for 10 days. </p>
<p>Bedding and clothing should be decontaminated (i.e., either
machine-washed or machine-dried using the heat cycle or
 dry-cleaned) or
removed from body contact for at least 72 hours. Fumigation of
 living areas
is not necessary. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Patients should be evaluated after 1 week if symptoms persist.
Re-treatment may be necessary if lice are found or if eggs are
 observed at
the hair-skin junction. Patients who do not respond to one of the
recommended regimens should be re-treated with an alternative
 regimen. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners </p>
<p>Sex partners within the preceding month should be treated. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnant and lactating women should be treated with either
 permethrin
or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Patients who have pediculosis pubis and also are infected with
 HIV
should receive the same treatment regimen as those who are
 HIV-negative. </p>
<p>Scabies </p>
<p>The predominant symptom of scabies is pruritus. Sensitization
 to
Sarcoptes scabiei must occur before pruritus begins. The first time
 a
person is infected with S. scabiei, sensitization takes several
 weeks to
develop. Pruritus might occur within 24 hours after a subsequent
reinfestation. Scabies in adults may be sexually transmitted,
 although
scabies in children usually is not. </p>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Permethrin cream (5%) applied to all areas of the body from the
 neck
down and washed off after 8-14 hours. </p>
<p>Alternative Regimens </p>
<p>Lindane (1%) 1 oz. of lotion or 30 g of cream applied thinly to
 all
areas of the body from the neck down and thoroughly washed off
 after 8
hours.
OR
Sulfur (6%) precipitated in ointment applied thinly to all
 areas
nightly for 3 nights. Previous applications should be washed
 off before
new applications are applied. Thoroughly wash off 24 hours
 after the
last application. </p>
<p>Permethrin is effective and safe but costs more than lindane.
 Lindane
is effective in most areas of the country, but lindane resistance
 has been
reported in some areas of the world, including parts of the United
 States.
Seizures have occurred when lindane was applied after a bath or
 used by
patients who had extensive dermatitis. Aplastic anemia following
 lindane
use also has been reported. </p>
<p>NOTE: Lindane should not be used after a bath, and it should not be
 used by </p>
<ol type="a">
    <li><p>
    persons who have extensive dermatitis, b) pregnant or lactating
 women,
    and c) children aged less than 2 years. </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Ivermectin (single oral dose of 200 ug/kg or 0.8% topical
 solution) is
a potential new therapeutic modality. However, no controlled
 clinical
trials have been conducted to compare ivermectin with the currently

recommended therapies. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>Bedding and clothing should be decontaminated (i.e., either
machine-washed or machine-dried using the hot cycle or dry-cleaned)
 or
removed from body contact for at least 72 hours. Fumigation of
 living areas
is unnecessary. </p>
<p>Follow-Up </p>
<p>Pruritus may persist for several weeks. Some experts recommend
re-treatment after 1 week for patients who are still symptomatic;
 other
experts recommend re-treatment only if live mites are observed.
 Patients
who do not respond to the recommended treatment should be retreated
 with an
alternative regimen. </p>
<p>Management of Sex Partners and Household Contacts </p>
<p>Both sexual and close personal or household contacts within the

preceding month should be examined and treated. </p>
<p>Management of Outbreaks in Communities, Nursing Homes, and Other
Institutional Settings </p>
<p>Scabies epidemics often occur in nursing homes, acute- and
 chronic-care
hospitals, residential facilities, and communities. Control of an
 epidemic
can only be achieved by treatment of the entire population at risk.

Epidemics should be managed in consultation with an expert. </p>
<p>Special Considerations </p>
<p>Infants, Young Children, and Pregnant or Lactating Women </p>
<p>Infants, young children, and pregnant or lactating women should
 not be
treated with lindane. They may be treated with permethrin. </p>
<p>HIV Infection </p>
<p>Patients who have uncomplicated scabies and also are infected
 with HIV
should receive the same treatment regimen as those who are
 HIV-negative.
HIV-infected patients and others who are immunosuppressed are at
 increased
risk for Norwegian scabies, a disseminated dermatologic infection.
 Such
patients should be managed in consultation with an expert. </p>
<br>
<p>SEXUAL ASSAULT AND STDs </p>
<p>Adults and Adolescents </p>
<p>The recommendations in this report are limited to the
 identification
and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and conditions
 commonly
identified in the management of such infections. The documentation
 of
findings and collection of nonmicrobiologic specimens for forensic
 purposes
and the management of potential pregnancy or physical and
 psychological
trauma are not included. Among sexually active adults, the
 identification
of sexually transmitted infections after an assault is usually more

important for the psychological and medical management of the
 patient than
for legal purposes, because the infection could have been acquired
 before
the assault. </p>
<p>Trichomoniasis, BV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea are the most
 frequently
diagnosed infections among women who have been sexually assaulted.
 Because
the prevalence of these STDs is substantial among sexually active
 women,
the presence of these infections after an assault does not
 necessarily
signify acquisition during the assault. Chlamydial and gonococcal
infections in women are of special concern because of the
 possibility of
ascending infection. In addition, HBV infection, if transmitted to
 a woman
during an assault, can be prevented by postexposure administration
 of
hepatitis B vaccine. </p>
<p>Evaluation for Sexually Transmitted Infections </p>
<p>Initial Examination </p>
<p>An initial examination should include the following procedures:
 </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Cultures for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis from specimens
 collected
    from any sites of penetration or attempted penetration. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    If chlamydial culture is not available, nonculture tests,
 particularly
    the nucleic acid amplification tests, are an acceptable
 substitute.
    Nucleic acid amplification tests offer advantages of increased
    sensitivity if confirmation is available. If a nonculture test
 is used,
    a positive test result should be verified with a second test
 based on a
    different diagnostic principle. EIA and direct fluorescent
 antibody are
    not acceptable alternatives, because false-negative test
 results occur
    more often with these nonculture tests, and false-positive test
 results
    may occur. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Wet mount and culture of a vaginal swab specimen for T.
 vaginalis
    infection. If vaginal discharge or malodor is evident, the wet
 mount
    also should be examined for evidence of BV and yeast infection.
 </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Collection of a serum sample for immediate evaluation for HIV,
    hepatitis B, and syphilis (see Prophylaxis, Risk for Acquiring
 HIV
    Infection and Follow-Up Examination 12 Weeks After Assault). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Follow-Up Examinations </p>
<p>Although it is often difficult for persons to comply with
 follow-up
examinations weeks after an assault, such examinations are
 essential a) to
detect new infections acquired during or after the assault; b) to
 complete
hepatitis B immunization, if indicated; and c) to complete
 counseling and
treatment for other STDs. For these reasons, it is recommended that
 assault
victims be reevaluated at follow-up examinations. </p>
<p>Follow-Up Examination After Assault </p>
<p>Examination for STDs should be repeated 2 weeks after the
 assault.
Because infectious agents acquired through assault may not have
 produced
sufficient concentrations of organisms to result in positive test
 results
at the initial examination, a culture (or cultures), a wet mount,
 and other
tests should be repeated at the 2-week follow-up visit unless
 prophylactic
treatment has already been provided. </p>
<p>Serologic tests for syphilis and HIV infection should be
 repeated 6,
12, and 24 weeks after the assault if initial test results were
 negative. </p>
<p>Prophylaxis </p>
<p>Many experts recommend routine preventive therapy after a
 sexual
assault. Most patients probably benefit from prophylaxis because
 the
follow-up of patients who have been sexually assaulted can be
 difficult,
and they may be reassured if offered treatment or prophylaxis for
 possible
infection. The following prophylactic regimen is suggested as
 preventive
therapy: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination (without HBIG) should
 adequately
    protect against HBV. Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered
 to
    victims of sexual assault at the time of the initial
 examination.
    Follow-up doses of vaccine should be administered 1-2 and 4-6
 months
    after the first dose. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, gonorrhea,
 trichomonas,
    and BV should be administered. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended Regimen </p>
<p>Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM in a single dose,
PLUS
Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose,
PLUS
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose or Doxycycline 100 mg
 orally
twice a day for 7 days. </p>
<p>NOTE: For patients requiring alternative treatments, see the
 sections in
this report that specifically address those agents. </p>
<p>The efficacy of these regimens in preventing gonorrhea, BV, or
 C.
trachomatis genitourinary infections after sexual assault has not
 been
evaluated. The clinician might consider counseling the patient
 regarding
the possible benefits, as well as the possibility of toxicity,
 associated
with these treatment regimens, because of possible gastrointestinal
 side
effects with this combination. </p>
<p>Other Management Considerations </p>
<p>At the initial examination and, if indicated, at follow-up
examinations, patients should be counseled regarding the following:
 </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Symptoms of STDs and the need for immediate examination if
 symptoms
    occur, and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Abstinence from sexual intercourse until STD prophylactic
 treatment is
    completed. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection </p>
<p>Although HIV-antibody seroconversion has been reported among
 persons
whose only known risk factor was sexual assault or sexual abuse,
 the risk
for acquiring HIV infection through sexual assault is low. The
 overall
probability of HIV transmission from an HIV-infected person during
 a single
act of intercourse depends on many factors. These factors may
 include the
type of sexual intercourse (i.e., oral, vaginal, or anal); presence
 of
oral, vaginal or anal trauma; site of exposure to ejaculate; viral
 load in
ejaculate; and presence of an STD. </p>
<p>In certain circumstances, the likelihood of HIV transmission
 also may
be affected by postexposure therapy for HIV with antiretroviral
 agents.
Postexposure therapy with zidovudine has been associated with a
 reduced
risk for HIV infection in a study of health-care workers who had
percutaneous exposures to HIV-infected blood. On the basis of these
 results
and the biologic plausibility of the effectiveness of
 antiretroviral agents
in preventing infection, postexposure therapy has been recommended
 for
health-care workers who have percutaneous exposures to HIV.
 However,
whether these findings can be extrapolated to other HIV-exposure
situations, including sexual assault, is unknown. A recommendation
 cannot
be made, on the basis of available information, regarding the
appropriateness of postexposure antiretroviral therapy after sexual

exposure to HIV. </p>
<p>Health-care providers who consider offering postexposure
 therapy should
take into account the likelihood of exposure to HIV, the potential
 benefits
and risks of such therapy, and the interval between the exposure
 and
initiation of therapy. Because timely determination of the
 HIV-infection
status of the assailant is not possible in many sexual assaults,
 the
health-care provider should assess the nature of the assault, any
 available
information about HIV-risk behaviors exhibited by persons who are
 sexual
assailants (e.g., high-risk sexual practices and injecting-drug or
 crack
cocaine use), and the local epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. If
 antiretroviral
postexposure prophylaxis is offered, the following information
 should be
discussed with the patient: a) the unknown efficacy and known
 toxicities of
antiretrovirals, b) the critical need for frequent dosing of
 medications,
c) the close follow-up that is necessary, d) the importance of
 strict
compliance with the recommended therapy, and e) the necessity of
 immediate
initiation of treatment for maximal likelihood of effectiveness. If
 the
patient decides to take postexposure therapy, clinical management
 of the
patient should be implemented according to the guidelines for
 occupational
mucous membrane exposure. </p>
<p>Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children </p>
<p>Recommendations in this report are limited to the
 identification and
treatment of STDs. Management of the psychosocial aspects of the
 sexual
assault or abuse of children is important but is not included in
 these
recommendations. </p>
<p>The identification of sexually transmissible agents in children
 beyond
the neonatal period suggests sexual abuse. However, there are
 exceptions;
for example, rectal or genital infection with C. trachomatis among
 young
children may be the result of perinatally acquired infection and
 may
persist for as long as 3 years. In addition, genital warts, BV, and
 genital
mycoplasmas have been diagnosed in children who have been abused
 and in
those not abused. There are several modes by which HBV is
 transmitted to
children; the most common of these is household exposure to persons
 who
have chronic HBV infection. </p>
<p>The possibility of sexual abuse should be considered if no
 obvious risk
factor for infection can be identified. When the only evidence of
 sexual
abuse is the isolation of an organism or the detection of
 antibodies to a
sexually transmissible agent, findings should be confirmed and the
implications considered carefully. The evaluation for determining
 whether
sexual abuse has occurred among children who have infections that
 can be
sexually transmitted should be conducted in compliance with expert
recommendations by practitioners who have experience and training
 in the
evaluation of abused or assaulted children (29). </p>
<p>Evaluation for Sexually Transmitted Infections </p>
<p>Examinations of children for sexual assault or abuse should be
conducted so as to minimize pain and trauma to the child. The
 decision to
evaluate the child for STDs must be made on an individual basis.
 Situations
involving a high risk for STDs and a strong indication for testing
 include
the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    A suspected offender is known to have an STD or to be at high
 risk for
    STDs (e.g., has multiple sex partners or a history of STD). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The child has symptoms or signs of an STD or of an infection
 that can
    be sexually transmitted. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    The prevalence of STDs in the community is high. Other
 indications
    recommended by experts include a) evidence of genital or oral
    penetration or ejaculation or b) STDs in siblings or other
 children or
    adults in the household. If a child has symptoms, signs, or
 evidence of
    an infection that might be sexually transmitted, the child
 should be
    tested for other common STDs. Obtaining the indicated specimens

    requires skill to avoid psychological and physical trauma to
 the child.
    The clinical manifestations of some STDs are different among
 children
    in comparison with adults. Examinations and specimen
 collections should
    be conducted by practitioners who have experience and training
 in the
    evaluation of abused or assaulted children. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A principal purpose of the examination is to obtain evidence of
 an
infection that is likely to have been sexually transmitted.
 However,
because of the legal and psychosocial consequences of a
 false-positive
diagnosis, only tests with high specificities should be used. The
additional cost of such tests and the time required to conduct them
 are
justified. </p>
<p>The scheduling of examinations should depend on the history of
 assault
or abuse. If the initial exposure was recent, the infectious agents

acquired through the exposure may not have produced sufficient
concentrations of organisms to result in positive test results. A
 follow-up
visit approximately 2 weeks after the most recent sexual exposure
 should
include a repeat physical examination and collection of additional
specimens. To allow sufficient time for antibodies to develop,
 another
follow-up visit approximately 12 weeks after the most recent sexual

exposure may be necessary to collect sera. A single examination may
 be
sufficient if the child was abused for an extended time period or
 if the
last suspected episode of abuse occurred well before the child
 received the
medical evaluation. </p>
<p>The following recommendation for scheduling examinations is a
 general
guide. The exact timing and nature of follow-up contacts should be
determined on an individual basis and should be considerate of the
 child's
psychological and social needs. Compliance with follow-up
 appointments may
be improved when law enforcement personnel or child protective
 services are
involved. </p>
<p>Initial and 2-Week Follow-Up Examinations </p>
<p>During the initial examination and 2-week follow-up examination
 (if
indicated), the following should be performed: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Visual inspection of the genital, perianal, and oral areas for
 genital
    warts and ulcerative lesions. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Cultures for N. gonorrhoeae specimens collected from the
 pharynx and
    anus in both boys and girls, the vagina in girls, and the
 urethra in
    boys. Cervical specimens are not recommended for prepubertal
 girls. For
    boys, a meatal specimen of urethral discharge is an adequate
 substitute
    for an intraurethral swab specimen when discharge is present.
 Only
    standard culture systems for the isolation of N. gonorrhoeae
 should be
    used. All presumptive isolates of N. gonorrhoeae should be
 confirmed by
    at least two tests that involve different principles (e.g.,
    biochemical, enzyme substrate, or serologic methods). Isolates
 should
    be preserved in case additional or repeated testing is needed. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Cultures for C. trachomatis from specimens collected from the
 anus in
    both boys and girls and from the vagina in girls. Limited
 information
    suggests that the likelihood of recovering Chlamydia from the
 urethra
    of prepubertal boys is too low to justify the trauma involved
 in
    obtaining an intraurethral specimen. A urethral specimen should
 be
    obtained if urethral discharge is present. Pharyngeal specimens
 for C.
    trachomatis also are not recommended for either sex because the
 yield
    is low, perinatally acquired infection may persist beyond
 infancy, and
    culture systems in some laboratories do not distinguish between
 C.
    trachomatis and C. pneumoniae. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Only standard culture systems for the isolation of C.
 trachomatis
should be used. The isolation of C. trachomatis should be
 confirmed by
microscopic identification of inclusions by staining with
fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for C.
 trachomatis.
Isolates should be preserved. Nonculture tests for chlamydia
 are not
sufficiently specific for use in circumstances involving
 possible child
abuse or assault. Data are insufficient to adequately assess
 the
utility of nucleic acid amplification tests in the evaluation
 of
children who might have been sexually abused, but expert
 opinion
suggests these tests may be an alternative if confirmation is
 available
but culture systems for C. trachomatis are unavailable. </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Culture and wet mount of a vaginal swab specimen for T.
 vaginalis
    infection. The presence of clue cells in the wet mount or other
 signs,
    such as a positive whiff test, suggests BV in girls who have
 vaginal
    discharge. The significance of clue cells or other indicators
 of BV as
    an indicator of sexual exposure is unclear. The clinical
 significance
    of clue cells or other indicators of BV in the absence of
 vaginal
    discharge also is unclear. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Collection of a serum sample to be evaluated immediately,
 preserved for
    subsequent analysis, and used as a baseline for comparison with

    follow-up serologic tests. Sera should be tested immediately
 for
    antibodies to sexually transmitted agents. Agents for which
 suitable
    tests are available include T. pallidum, HIV, and HBsAg. The
 choice of
    agents for serologic tests should be made on a case-by-case
 basis (see
    Examination 12 Weeks After Assault). HIV antibodies have been
 reported
    in children whose only known risk factor was sexual abuse.
 Serologic
    testing for HIV infection should be considered for abused
 children. The
    decision to test for HIV infection should be made on a
 case-by-case
    basis, depending on likelihood of infection among assailant(s).
 Data
    are insufficient concerning the efficacy and safety of
 postexposure
    prophylaxis among children. Vaccination for HBV should be
 recommended
    if the medical history or serologic testing suggests that it
 has not
    been received (see Hepatitis B). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Examination 12 Weeks After Assault </p>
<p>An examination approximately 12 weeks after the last suspected
 sexual
exposure is recommended to allow time for antibodies to infectious
 agents
to develop if baseline tests are negative. Serologic tests for T.
 pallidum,
HIV, and HBsAg should be considered. The prevalence of these
 infections
differs substantially by community, and serologic testing depends
 on
whether risk factors are known to be present in the abuser or
 assailant. In
addition, results of HBsAg testing must be interpreted carefully,
 because
HBV also can be transmitted nonsexually. The choice of tests must
 be made
on an individual basis. </p>
<p>Presumptive Treatment </p>
<p>The risk for a child's acquiring an STD as a result of sexual
 abuse has
not been determined. The risk is believed to be low in most
 circumstances,
although documentation to support this position is inadequate. </p>
<p>Presumptive treatment for children who have been sexually
 assaulted or
abused is not widely recommended because girls appear to be at
 lower risk
for ascending infection than adolescent or adult women, and regular

follow-up usually can be ensured. However, some children -- or
 their
parent(s) or guardian(s) -- may be concerned about the possibility
 of
infection with an STD, even if the risk is perceived by the
 health-care
provider to be low. Patient or parental/guardian concerns may be an

appropriate indication for presumptive treatment in some settings
 (i.e.,
after all specimens relevant to the investigation have been
 collected). </p>
<p>Reporting </p>
<p>Every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the
 U.S.
Virgin Islands, and American Samoa have laws that require the
 reporting of
child abuse. The exact requirements differ by state, but,
 generally, if
there is reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, it must be
 reported.
Health-care providers should contact their state or local
 child-protection
service agency about child abuse reporting requirements in their
 areas. </p>
