<H1>Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule --- United 
States, October 2005--September 2006</FONT></H1>
<p><a href="../../PDF/wk/mm5345-Immunization.pdf">
<img alt="Click here for PDF file" src="../../images/icon_acro.gif" align="middle" border="0" width="21" height="22"></a>
<a href="../../PDF/wk/mm5440-Immunization.pdf"><font size="2">
PDF</font></a></p>
</P><P>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) annually reviews the recommended Adult 
Immunization Schedule to ensure that the schedule reflects current recommendations for the use of licensed vaccines. In June 2005, 
ACIP approved the Adult Immunization Schedule for October 
2005--September 2006. This schedule has also been approved by 
the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
<H4>
<B>Changes in the Schedule for October 2005--September 2006 </B>
</H4>
</P><P>The 2005--2006 schedule differs from the previous 
schedule as follows:
</P><UL>
<LI>Vaccines listed on the age-based schedule (<a href = "#fig1">Figure 1</a>) are displayed so that vaccines recommended for routine use can 
be differentiated from those recommended for adults with certain risk indicators (similar to the 
childhood immunization schedule). This is illustrated both by the color scheme and by the broken line.
<LI>The yellow bars (&quot;For all persons in this group&quot;) and the green bars (&quot;For persons lacking documentation of 
vaccination or evidence of disease&quot;) from the previous schedule have been merged into one yellow bar, which now reads, &quot;For 
all persons in this category who meet the age requirements and who lack evidence of 
immunity (e.g., lack documentation of vaccination or have no evidence of prior infection).&quot;
<LI>The purple bar has been changed from &quot;For persons at risk (e.g., with medical/exposure indications)&quot; 
to &quot;Recommended if some other risk factor is present (e.g., on the basis of medical, occupational, lifestyle, or 
other indications).&quot; The purple bar was added to the 50--64 
years and <U>&gt;</U>65 years age-group columns for 
measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.
<LI>The column, &quot;Diabetes, heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or chronic liver disease including chronic 
alcoholism&quot; has been transposed with the column, 
&quot;Congenital immunodeficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized 
malignancy, therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, radiation, or large amounts of corticosteroids&quot; 
on the medical/other indications schedule (<a href = "#fig2">Figure 2</a>) so that contraindications for MMR and varicella vaccines are now 
side-by-side.
<LI>The row for varicella vaccine has been moved up on both figures (i.e., to immediately after MMR vaccine) because the vaccine 
is now universally recommended for certain age groups.
<LI>Meningococcal vaccine has been added to the medical/other indications schedule (<a href = "#fig2">Figure 2</a>). The footnote has 
been revised to incorporate the recently published ACIP recommendations for this vaccine 
(<I><a href="rr5407a1.htm">1</a></I>).
<LI>The tetanus and diphtheria footnote (#1) has been reworded.
<LI>The varicella footnote (#3) has been reworded in accordance with ACIP recommendations adopted in June 2005.
<LI>The influenza footnote (#4) has been revised to add the newest high-risk condition: neuromuscular conditions 
that compromise respiratory function (<I><a href="rr5408a1.htm">2</a></I>).
<LI>A 10th footnote has been added regarding 
<I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> type b vaccination for populations at high risk 
(i.e., persons with asplenia, leukemia, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection).
</UL>

<P><B>Approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American College 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians
</P><P>1. Tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccination.</B> Adults with uncertain histories of a complete primary vaccination series with diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccines should receive a primary series using combined Td toxoid. A primary series for adults is 
3 doses; administer the first 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6--12 months after the second. Administer 1 dose if the person received the primary series and if the 
last vaccination was received <U>&gt;</U>10 years previously. Consult the ACIP statement   for recommendations for administering Td as prophylaxis in 
wound management (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00041645.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00041645.htm</a>). The American College of Physicians Task Force on Adult 
Immunization supports a second option for Td use in adults: a single Td booster at age 50 years for persons who have completed the full pediatric series, including 
the teenage/young adult booster. A newly licensed tetanus-diphtheria-acellular--pertussis vaccine is available for adults. ACIP recommendations for its 
use will be published.
</P><P><B>2. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination. 
</B><I>Measles component</I>: adults born before 1957 can be considered immune to 
measles. Adults born during or after 1957 should receive 
<U>&gt;</U>1 dose<B> </B>of MMR unless they have a medical contraindication, documentation of 
<U>&gt;</U>1 dose, history of measles based on health-care provider diagnosis, or laboratory evidence of immunity. A second dose of MMR 
is recommended for adults who 1) were recently exposed to measles or in an outbreak setting; 2) were previously vaccinated with 
killed measles vaccine; 3) were vaccinated with an unknown type of measles vaccine during 1963--1967; 4) are students in 
postsecondary educational institutions; 5) work in a health-care facility; or 6) plan to travel internationally. Withhold MMR or other 
measles-containing vaccines from HIV-infected persons with severe immunosuppression. 
<I>Mumps component</I>:<I> </I>1 dose of MMR vaccine should be 
adequate for protection for those born during or after 1957 who lack a history of mumps based on health-care provider diagnosis or who 
lack laboratory evidence of immunity. <I>Rubella 
component</I>:<I> </I>administer 1 dose of MMR vaccine to women whose rubella vaccination history 
is unreliable or who lack laboratory evidence of immunity. For women of childbearing age, regardless of birth year, routinely 
determine rubella immunity and counsel women regarding congenital rubella syndrome. Do not vaccinate women who are pregnant or who 
might become pregnant within 4 weeks of receiving vaccine. Women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive MMR 
vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility.
</P><P><B>3. Varicella vaccination. </B>Varicella vaccination is recommended for all adults without evidence of immunity to varicella. 
Special consideration should be given to those who 1) have close contact with persons at high risk for severe disease (health-care workers 
and family contacts of immunocompromised persons) or 2) are at high risk for exposure or transmission (e.g., teachers of young 
children; child care employees; residents and staff members of institutional settings, including correctional institutions; college students; 
military personnel; adolescents and adults living in households with children; nonpregnant women of childbearing age; and 
international travelers). Evidence of immunity to varicella in adults includes any of the following:  1) documented age-appropriate varicella 
vaccination (i.e., receipt of 1 dose before age 13 years or receipt of 2 doses [administered at least 4 weeks apart] after age 13 years); 2) 
U.S.-born before 1966 or history of varicella disease before 1966 for non-U.S.--born persons; 3) history of varicella based on health-care 
provider diagnosis or parental or self-report of typical varicella disease for persons born during 1966--1997 (for a patient reporting a history of 
an atypical, mild case, health-care providers should seek either an epidemiologic link with a typical varicella case or evidence of 
laboratory confirmation, if it was performed at the time of acute disease); 4) history of herpes zoster based on health-care provider diagnosis; or 
5) laboratory evidence of immunity. Do not vaccinate women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant within 4 weeks of 
receiving the vaccine. Assess pregnant women for evidence of varicella immunity. Women who do not have evidence of immunity should 
receive dose 1 of varicella vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility. Dose 
2 should be administered 4--8 weeks after dose 1. 
</P><P><B>4. Influenza vaccination.</B> <I>Medical 
indications</I>:<I> </I>chronic disorders of the cardiovascular or pulmonary systems, including asthma; 
chronic metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression 
(including immunosuppression caused by medications or HIV); any condition (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, spinal cord injury, seizure disorder, 
or other neuromuscular disorder) that compromises respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase 
the risk for aspiration; and pregnancy during the influenza season. No data exist on the risk for severe or complicated influenza 
disease among persons with asplenia; however, influenza is a risk factor for secondary bacterial infections that can cause severe 
disease among persons with asplenia. <I>Occupational 
indications</I>:<I> </I>health-care workers and employees of long-term--care and assisted 
living facilities. <I>Other indications</I>: residents of nursing homes and other long-term--care and assisted living facilities; persons likely to 
transmit influenza to persons at high risk (i.e., in-home household contacts and caregivers of children aged 0--23 months, or persons of all 
ages with high-risk conditions), and anyone who wishes to be vaccinated. For healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 5--49 years without 
high-risk conditions who are not contacts of severely immunocompromised persons in special care units, intranasally 
administered influenza vaccine 
(FluMist<SUP>&#174;</SUP>) may be administered in lieu of inactivated vaccine. 
</P><P><B>5. Pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccination.</B> <I>Medical indications</I>:<I> 
</I>chronic disorders of the pulmonary system (excluding 
asthma); cardiovascular diseases; diabetes mellitus; chronic liver diseases, including liver disease as a result of alcohol abuse (e.g., 
cirrhosis); chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome; functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy [if 
elective splenectomy is planned, vaccinate at least 2 weeks before surgery]); immunosuppressive conditions (e.g., congenital 
immunodeficiency, HIV infection [vaccinate as close to diagnosis as possible when CD4 cell counts are highest], leukemia, lymphoma, multiple 
myeloma, Hodgkin disease, generalized malignancy, or organ or bone marrow transplantation); chemotherapy with alkylating 
agents, antimetabolites, or long-term systemic corticosteroids; and cochlear implants. 
<I>Other indications</I>:<I> </I>Alaska Natives and certain 
American Indian populations; residents of nursing homes and other long-term--care facilities.
</P><P><B>6. Revaccination with pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine.</B> One-time revaccination after 5 years for persons with chronic 
renal failure or nephritic syndrome; functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy); immunosuppressive 
conditions (e.g., congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin disease, generalized malignancy, 
or organ or bone marrow transplantation); or chemotherapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, or long-term systemic 
corticosteroids. For persons aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years, one-time revaccination if they were vaccinated 
<U>&gt;</U>5 years previously and were aged &lt;65 years at the time 
of primary vaccination.
</P><P><B>7. Hepatitis A vaccination.</B> <I>Medical 
indications</I>:<I> </I>persons with clotting-factor disorders or chronic liver disease. 
<I>Behavioral indications</I>:<I> </I>men who have sex with men or users of illegal drugs. 
<I>Occupational indications</I>: Persons working with hepatitis A virus 
(HAV)--infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting. 
<I>Other indications</I>: persons traveling to or working in countries that have high 
or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A (for list of countries, see
		<a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentDiseases.aspx#hepa">http://www.cdc.gov/travel/diseases.htm#hepa</a>) as well as any 
person wishing to obtain immunity. Current vaccines should be administered in a 2-dose series at either 0 and 6--12 months, or 0 and 
6--18 months. If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is used, administer 
3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months.
</P><P><B>8. Hepatitis B vaccination.</B> <I>Medical 
indications</I>:<I> </I>hemodialysis patients (use special formulation [40 
<I>&#181;</I>g/mL] or two 20-<I>&#181;</I>g/mL doses) 
or patients who receive clotting-factor concentrates. 
<I>Occupational indications</I>: health-care workers and public-safety workers who 
have exposure to blood in the workplace and persons in training in schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, laboratory technology, and 
other allied health professions. <I>Behavioral 
indications</I>: injection-drug users; persons with more than one sex partner during the previous 
6 months; persons with a recently acquired sexually transmitted disease (STD); and men who have sex with men. 
<I>Other indications</I>: household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; clients and staff members of 
institutions for developmentally disabled persons; all clients of STD clinics; inmates of correctional facilities; and international travelers who will be 
in countries with high or intermediate prevalence of chronic HBV infection for more than 6 months (for list of countries, see 
		<a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentDiseases.aspx#hepa">http://www.cdc.gov/travel/diseases.htm#hepa</a>).
</P><P><B>9. Meningococcal vaccination.</B> <I>Medical 
indications</I>: adults with anatomic or functional asplenia or terminal complement 
component deficiencies. <I>Other 
indications</I>:<I> </I>first-year college students living in dormitories; microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates 
of <I>Neisseria meningitidis</I>; military recruits; and persons who travel to or reside in countries in which meningococcal disease 
is hyperendemic or epidemic (e.g., the &quot;meningitis belt&quot; of sub-Saharan Africa during the dry season [December--June]), particularly 
if contact with local populations will be prolonged. Vaccination is required by the government of Saudi Arabia for all travelers to 
Mecca during the annual Hajj. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is preferred for adults meeting any of the above indications who are aged 
<U>&lt;</U>55 years, although meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) is an acceptable alternative. Revaccination after 5 years might 
be indicated for adults previously vaccinated with MPSV4 who remain at high risk for infection (e.g., persons residing in areas in 
which disease is epidemic). 
</P><P><B>10. Selected conditions for which <I>Haemophilus influenzae 
</I>type b (Hib) vaccine may be used.</B> Hib conjugate vaccines are 
licensed for children aged 6--71 months. No efficacy data are available on which to base a recommendation concerning use of Hib vaccine 
for older children and adults with the chronic conditions associated with an increased risk for Hib disease. However, studies suggest 
good immunogenicity in patients who have sickle cell disease, leukemia, or HIV infection or who have had splenectomies; 
administering vaccine to these patients is not contraindicated.
