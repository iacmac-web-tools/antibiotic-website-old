<font class="print-title">Effect of Increased Daily Water Intake in Premenopausal Women With Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections: A&nbsp;Randomized Clinical Trial</font><br>

<font class="print-normal">Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes of fluid daily.<hr size="1"><br>
<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p class="j">Importance &#151; Increased hydration is often recommended as a preventive measure for women with recurrent cystitis, but supportive data are sparse.</p>
<p><b>Objective</b></p>
<p class="j">To assess the efficacy of increased daily water intake on the frequency of recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women.</p>
<p><b>Design, Setting, and Participants</b></p>
<p class="j">Randomized, open-label, controlled, 12-month trial at a clinical research center (years 2013-2016). Among 163 healthy women with recurrent cystitis (&ge;3 episodes in past year) drinking less than 1.5&nbsp;L of fluid daily assessed for eligibility, 23 were excluded and 140 assigned to water or control group. Assessments of daily fluid intake, urinary hydration, and cystitis symptoms were performed at baseline, 6- and 12-month visits, and monthly telephone calls.</p>
<p class="j">Interventions &#151; Participants were randomly assigned to drink, in addition to their usual fluid intake, 1.5&nbsp;L of water daily (water group) or no additional fluids (control group) for 12 months.</p>
<p><b>Main Outcomes and Measures</b></p>
<p class="j">Primary outcome measure was frequency of recurrent cystitis over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were number of antimicrobial regimens used, mean time interval between cystitis episodes, and 24-hour urinary hydration measurements.</p>
<p><b>Results</b></p>
<p class="j">The mean (SD) age of the 140 participants was 35.7 (8.4) years, and the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes in the previous year was 3.3 (0.6). During the 12-month study period, the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes was 1.7 (95%&nbsp;CI, 1.5-1.8) in the water group compared with 3.2 (95%&nbsp;CI, 3.0-3.4) in the control group, with a difference in means of 1.5 (95%&nbsp;CI, 1.2-1.8; P&lt;.001). Overall, there were 327 cystitis episodes, 111 in the water group and 216 in the control group. The mean number of antimicrobial regimens used to treat cystitis episodes was 1.9 (95%&nbsp;CI, 1.7-2.2) and 3.6 (95%&nbsp;CI, 3.3-4.0), respectively, with a difference in means of 1.7 (95%&nbsp;CI, 1.3-2.1; P&lt;.001). The mean time interval between cystitis episodes was 142.8 (95%&nbsp;CI, 127.4-160.1) and 84.4 (95%&nbsp;CI, 75.4-94.5) days, respectively, with a difference in means of 58.4 (95%&nbsp;CI, 39.4-77.4; P&lt;.001). Between baseline and 12 months, participants in the water group, compared with those in the control group, had increased mean (SD) urine volume (1.4 [0.04] vs 0.1 [0.04]&nbsp;L; P&lt;.001) and voids (2.4 [0.2] <i>vs</i> -0.1 [0.2]; P&lt;.001) and decreased urine osmolality (-402.8 [19.6] <i>vs</i> -24.0 [19.5] mOsm/kg; P&lt;.001).</p>
<p><b>Conclusions and Relevance</b></p>
<p class="j">Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes of fluid daily.</p>
